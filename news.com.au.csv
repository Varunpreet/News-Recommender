A University of Melbourne lecturer detained in Iran has been transferred to one of the worst female prisons in the world.,"['world', 'middle east'] []","Human rights activist Kylie Moore-Gilbert was arrested in Iran in 2018 and sentenced to 10 years in jail accused of spying after attending a conference in Tehran and was being held in the notorious Evin prison near the Alborz mountains. The Evin prison is known for human rights abuses and primarily holds female political prisoners. The prison has an execution yard and its own court. Human rights activist Reza Khandan posted the news of Ms Moore-Gilbert’s transfer from Evin prison to Qarchak prison – believed to be the worst women’s prison on earth – on Facebook this week. Qarchak is known as the “most dangerous and worst” prison in the country for its poor psychological, medical and inhumane treatment of its prisoners. Former inmates described the conditions inside as “abysmal”.

Picture: InstagramSource:Supplied Ms Moore-Gilbert, a British-Australian dual national, was reportedly transferred to the prison “as punishment”. The Cambridge-educated lecturer said during a call with Mr Khandan: “I can’t eat anything … I don’t know … I’m so disappointed … I’m so very … depressed …”. Ms Moore-Gilbert has already spent almost two years in prison, sleeping on the floor of her cell in Tehran where she’s been held since September 2018, according to the BBC. She has maintained her innocence since she was arrested while travelling with an Australian passport at Tehran airport. She’d been trying to leave the country for Melbourne when she was detained after being flagged as “suspicious”, after attending an academic conference. Qarchak prison is located in a desert in eastern Tehran.Source:Supplied RELATED: Iran executions: Hope after court confirms death penalty for protesters A report suggests the Qarchak prison is subject to severe overcrowding, and has no separate rooms for inmates. Prisoners sleep in large, open areas with only 600 beds for more than 2000 inmates. The situation means every night more than 1400 women and children sleep on the floor. The prisoners are also not divided in any way – with political prisoners kept in the same area as violent offenders, according to a report from the Human Rights’ Activists News Agency (HRANA). Women in Qarchak prison are also subjected to torture including rape, beatings and insults from guards, according to the report. The HRANA report claims one form of punishment is to confine prisoners who complain about the conditions in a “solitary cell with another mentally disturbed prisoner, as a method of torture”. There is also poor access to warm water and only four bathrooms for each district in the prison. The facility, which is set in a desert in eastern Tehran, is serviced its water by a nearby salt water lake, and the salinity has caused many female prisoners to have skin conditions. The conditions have had a number of flow on effects, including the creation of a black market for vital medicines between inmates. It’s also led to the spread of conditions including AIDS and hepatitis. The report said the severity of the impact was based on the women who self-report having AIDS, with the director of the health department at Qarchak Prison saying examining all the prisoners was financially prohibitive.

1,"Aussies are ‘soft’: Residents locked down for 200 days in Angeles, Philippines",A man living under a severe lockdown in a city where rations are doled out says the mayor of his city makes Daniel Andrews look like a “pussycat”. A man living under a severe lockdown in the Philippines city of Angeles said the mayor of his area makes Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews look like a “pussycat”. ,"['world', 'asia'] []","Angeles resident Andrew Fleming told news.com.au the harsh coronavirus lockdowns in his hometown have meant people under the age of 21 and those over the age of 60 and pregnant women have been “confined to the house” for 200 days. He said people had been living on rations and he himself had only received one delivery of a bag of rice and 20 cans of sardines throughout the pandemic. The highly urbanised city in the Philippines has a population of more than 411,000 with 183 active cases recorded on September 17. Mayor Carmelo Lazatin, Jr has published an extensive list of regulations that include a curfew from 11pm to 5am, quarantine passes for those leaving home, mandatory wearing of masks and face shields in some places and strict bans on public gatherings. Buffet meals are banned and gyms must operate at 30 per cent capacity, while those visiting indoor markets must have their feet washed before entry. RELATED: Premier hits back at Washington Post story Angeles City COVID-19 UPDATE as of September 17, 2020. Mr Fleming said before the pandemic hit the city was a bustling entertainment capital, known for its bars and night spots. But now people meeting for a drink hide their beers in coffee cups “1920s style” so patrolling police can’t catch them drinking. Mr Fleming said the city had closed all the bars apart from those inside restaurants — and entry was conditional — punters need to wear a mask and a face shield, have their temperature checked, give over contact details, have their hands and feet sanitised and then sit behind plastic shields. The state of Victoria has endured its own harsh lockdown for the past six weeks, with stage four lockdowns enforced in metropolitan Melbourne. But Mr Fleming thinks complaining Aussies are being soft. RELATED:  Follow our live coronavirus coverage A child is swabbed in the city of Angeles in a house to house vaccination project for polio.

In metropolitan Melbourne, residents have only been allowed to leave their home for four specific reasons, and have been under a strict curfew from 8pm to 5am — which was extended to 9pm-5am last week. But Mr Fleming said “Aussies amaze me when they complain about conditions, they are soft”. He said Angeles had been closed off to tourists and bus services to and from other cities had been abandoned. Between suburbs (called Barangays) there were police checkpoints. Motorcyclists with pillion passengers have to put a shield between them and the passengers while travelling, he said. The most recent list of regulations in the city of Angeles is 32 pages long. A resident wrote on the city’s Facebook page that the guidelines were “growing into a novel”. Meanwhile, metropolitan Melbourne is now on its way to easing out of restrictions. As the city’s 14-day-average for daily case numbers continues to track between 30 and 50, the Victorian capital is on target to ease restrictions by September 28. On Friday, Victoria reported 45 new cases of COVID-19. This took the city’s 14-day-average to 42.7, down from 44.4 the previous day. If numbers remain low, it will mean a range of restrictions are eased, including residents being able to socialise in “social bubbles” with other households. There would also be a phased return to work for some work forces and schools and universities. ",news.com.au,,"September 20, 2020"
2,Crown Resorts should not be given gaming licence says probe recommendations,"A probe into Crown has dealt a crushing blow to its $2.2bn Barangaroo project after damning allegations of bad corporate behaviour. A probe into Crown Resorts has recommended the embattled gaming giant have its Sydney casino licence revoked, in a crippling blow to its $2.2bn Barangaroo project.","['finance', 'business', 'other industries'] []","In a report tabled to the state parliament, the NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) said corporate “arrogance” was a driving factor in the company turning a blind eye to illegal money laundering within its Melbourne and Perth venues. ILGA in its findings said the James Packer-backed casino was not a suitable licensee holder and its state gaming clearance should be revoked. Media reports in 2019 alleged Crown facilitated money laundering activities at its Melbourne and Perth casinos through Asian high-roller junkets, sparking questions over whether it was fit to hold the licence. ILGA has recommended Crown Sydney should not be granted a gaming licence. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Flavio BrancaleoneSource:News Corp Australia Crown’s serious corporate failures included the arrest of employees in China in 2016 “with numerous failures to escalate indicators of real risks to the staff”, the report said. “Any applicant for a casino licence with the attributes of Crown’s stark realities of facilitating money laundering, exposing staff to the risk of detention in a foreign jurisdiction and pursuing commercial relationships with individuals with connections to triads and organised crime groups would not be confident of a positive outcome,” the report said. Commissioner Patricia Bergin said in her findings there was “significant deficiency” in Crown’s corporate character and a lack of understanding and compliance of the country’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws (AML/CTF). “Every single Crown director should have been versed in an understanding at the very least of: the methods by which money launderers can infiltrate and exploit the operations of the casino,” the report said. Commissioner Patricia Bergin in her findings said there was ‘significant deficiency’ in Crown’s corporate character.Source:Supplied During hearings, evidence pointed to Crown trying to rectify the issue by implementing a slapdash one-hour training session on AML/CTF laws. Ms Bergin said Crown’s character would never satisfy ILGA while it failed to implement proper measures to address the rise of money laundering within casinos. ILGA also found numerous governance failings by senior management and the board, including Mr Packer, who ignored criminal risks when trying to get Casino giant Melco to buy part of his stake in Crown. The report said “amazingly”, Mr Packer “did not turn his mind to the prospect” of the late Stanley Ho – who allegedly had underworld connections – having an interest in Hong Kong casino giant Melco, which planned to buy a 19.9 per cent interest in Crown. The inquiry heard Mr Packer was insistent the Melco deal go through, but it only ended up buying 10 per cent, dumping its plans to buy the second tranche in February last year, then offloading its interest to US private equity giant Blackstone in April. “The fact that Melco sold its shares and since April 2020 is no longer a shareholder and the fact that Mr Stanley Ho is now deceased, does not mean that it was unnecessary to explore these matters further.” Ms Bergin’s findings also found numerous failing of governance by senior management and the board, including James Packer.Source:Supplied Mr Packer’s “forgetfulness or failing to turn one’s mind” to ensuring casinos remained free from criminal influence “must surely be intolerable”. The inquiry also heard Mr Packer was given special treatment — getting privileged information through a controlling shareholder protocol agreement — despite quitting the board in 2018. Mr Packer’s special treatment agreement was terminated during the inquiry, so it was now a “stock standard” relationship, Crown’s lead lawyer Neil Young said. Counsel assisting the inquiry had argued Mr Packer should have no association with the Barangaroo venue at all due to prior poor behaviour. Mr Packer making a “very serious threat against a business colleague” in 2015 “demonstrates a flaw in his character such as to adversely affect his integrity”, the report read. His lieutenant Michael Johnston – an executive of his private investment vehicle Consolidated Press Holdings and a Crown director for the past 13 years — was found to have exacerbated the corporate governance failings at the group. ILGA in its findings said the James Packer-backed casino was not a suitable licensee holder and its state gaming clearance should be revoked. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Joel CarrettSource:News Corp Australia Ms Bergin’s report also took aim at chief executive Ken Barton for advocating to keep the Riverbank subsidiary account open without investigating possible connections to money laundering. “The authority would be justified in concluding that it cannot have any confidence in dealing with Mr Barton as a director of the licensee or Crown,” the report said. Chair Helen Coonan was exonerated of wrongdoing but the report said her understanding of the issues plaguing Crown was heavily reliant on Mr Barton’s advice and judgment. It was also noted ILGA had no confidence in Crown director Andrew Demetriou, who during testimonies provided a “most unedifying” and “quite bizarre performance” by reading from notes on the witness stand. The probe heard Australian Resorts chief executive Barry Felstead was warned in 2015 about staff being concerned for their safety and living in “constant fear of getting tapped on the shoulder” as they sought to lure Chinese high rollers to Crown’s Australian casinos. Media reports in 2019 alleged Crown facilitated money laundering activities at its Melbourne and Perth casinos. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Penny StephensSource:News Corp Australia But that information never made it through to the board or risk management committee, and 16 of the employees ended up serving jail time. Earlier on Tuesday, Crown began preparing for a potential investor backlash following the public release of the report, placing its shares into a trading halt. The report said an enforceable undertaking could be committed, however ILGA would not be satisfied while Guy Jalland and Michael Johnston remain as company directors. “If Crown is to survive this turmoil and convert itself into a company that can be regarded as a suitable person and achieve the same for the licensee, there is little doubt that it could achieve a fresh start and emerge a very much stronger and better organisation,” the report said. Crown prepared for a potential investor backlash by placing its shares into a trading halt. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Penny StephensSource:News Corp Australia NSW Customer Service Minister Victor Dominello said he would consider the recommendations before formally responding. “At the heart of the report is a relationship between organised crime, money laundering and gambling. And more importantly what steps we can do to protect the community against these sinister elements,” he said earlier in the day. An opposition spokeswoman said the report was “damning” and Labor would request a hearing with Mr Dominello. Independent MP and anti-gambling campaigner Andrew Wilkie said the findings had implications for Crown’s casinos in Melbourne and Perth. “Surely it’s self-evident that Commissioner Bergin’s findings mean the company is unfit to continue to operate any casino in Australia,” Mr Wilkie said. “To that end I call upon the premiers of Victoria and Western Australia to suspend Crown’s casino licences in their jurisdictions, and to immediately establish commissions of inquiry to get to the bottom of what is now a genuinely national issue. “I also call on the Prime Minister to revisit my repeated calls in the federal parliament for a royal commission into the casino industry.” Crown said in a statement lodged to the Australian Securities Exchange it reviewing ILGA’s report.

Global coronavirus cases have passed a grim new milestone, with more than 20 million infections since the pandemic first began.","['world', 'coronavirus', 'global'] ['coronavirus']","The most worrying part is not the numbers themselves, but the speed at which those numbers are accelerating. According to a Reuters tally, it took almost six months to reach 10 million coronavirus cases after the first infection was reported in Wuhan, China, back in early January. But it took just 43 days to double that tally to 20 million. RELATED: Follow our live coronavirus coverage  WHO’S DRIVING THE INFECTIONS? The United States, Brazil and India account for more than half of all known infections.

USA The United States has now passed five million confirmed infections, and continues to record tens of thousands of new cases each day. Its death toll, at 165,000, is the highest in the world.

Santiago/Getty Images/AFPSource:AFP The newspaper has examined data from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the government agency responsible for managing America’s epidemic, and found that there were actually 200,700 “excess deaths” throughout the US between March 15 and July 25. The excess deaths statistic measures how many more people than usual have died during a certain time period, based on historical data. In this case, 200,000 more people died than in a regular year – a figure 54,000 higher than the official coronavirus death toll from the same period. Experts have long warned that America’s death toll is underestimating the number of victims. “The number is likely higher. I don’t know exactly what per cent higher, but almost certainly it’s higher,” Dr Anthony Fauci said back in May. “Because given the situation, particularly in New York City, when they were really strapped with a very serious challenge to their healthcare system, there may have been people who died at home who did have COVID, who were not counted as COVID because they never really got to the hospital.” RELATED: 100,000 US kids catch coronavirus in two weeks RELATED: The countries that defeated COVID Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro famously dismissed the virus as a ‘little flu’.

Its leader, Jair Bolsonaro, has infamously dismissed the virus as a “little flu”, despite 50,000 people dying in three months – followed by another 50,000 in just 50 days. The Brazilian President’s handling of the pandemic has been criticised by both its Supreme Court and Congress, but he insists on prioritising the economy over health concerns. In a Facebook video that streamed on Thursday night, Mr Bolsonaro, who tested positive for the disease himself back in July, said: “I regret all the deaths, it’s already reaching the number 100,000, but we are going to find a way out of that.” INDIA India surpassed two million cases a few days ago, with one million new infections in less than a month. With more than 50,000 daily cases for the past seven days, it is now the country with the fastest increasing number of infections.

India started a phased reopening after a strict lockdown that was imposed on March 25. Temples and other places of worship were allowed to open in June.

HE SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN, AND GOT CAUGHT! WHY DID HE REFUSE TO ENDORSE SLOW JOE UNTIL IT WAS ALL OVER, AND EVEN THEN WAS VERY LATE? WHY DID HE TRY TO GET HIM NOT TO RUN? Mr Obama started his speech to the convention with an extended attack on the man who replaced him in the White House – and a bit of a history lesson. “As you’ve seen by now, this isn’t a normal convention. It’s not a normal time. So tonight, I want to talk as plainly as I can about the stakes in this election,” Mr Obama said. “I‘m in Philadelphia, where our Constitution was drafted and signed. It wasn’t a perfect document. It allowed for the inhumanity of slavery, and failed to guarantee women – and even men who didn’t own property – the right to participate in the political process. “But embedded in this document was a north star that would guide generations. A system of representative government, a democracy, through which we could better realise our highest ideals. “Through Civil War and bitter struggles, we improved this Constitution to include the voices of those who‘d once been left out. And gradually, we made this country more just, and more equal, and more free. “The one Constitutional office elected by all of the people is the presidency. So at a minimum, we should expect a president to feel a sense of responsibility for the safety and welfare of all 330 million of us. Regardless of what we look like, how we worship, who we love, how much money we have, or who we voted for. “We should also expect a president to be the custodian of this democracy. We should expect that, regardless of ego, ambition or political beliefs, the president will preserve, protect and defend the freedoms and ideals that so many Americans marched for, went to jail for, fought for and died for. “I have sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision, or continue my policies. I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously. That he might come to feel the weight of the office, and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care. “But he never did. For close to four years now, he has shown no interest in putting in the work. No interest in finding common ground. No interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends. No interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show he can use to get the attention he craves. “Donald Trump hasn‘t grown into the job, because he can’t. And the consequences of that failure are severe – 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone, while those at the top take in more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before. “I know that in times as polarised as these, most of you have already made up your mind. But maybe you‘re still not sure which candidate you’ll vote for, or whether you’ll vote at all. Maybe you’re tired of the direction we’re headed, but you can’t see a better path yet, or you just don’t know enough about the person who wants to lead us there.” Mr Obama then transitioned into praise for Joe Biden.

Can you talk about what you think about that, and what you have to say to people who are following this movement right now?” a reporter asked him. “Well I don’t know much about the movement, other than I understand they like me very much. Which I appreciate,” Mr Trump replied. “But I don’t know much about the movement. I have heard that it is gaining in popularity, and from what I hear, these are people that – when they watch the streets of Portland … these are people that don’t like what’s going on in places like Portland, in places like Chicago, and New York, and other cities. “And I’ve heard these are people that love our country. And they just don’t like seeing it. So I don’t know, really, anything about it, other than they do supposedly like me.” The reporter, NBC’s Shannon Pettypiece, clarified that QAnon believes Mr Trump is “secretly saving the world from this Satanic cult of paedophiles and cannibals”. “Well, I haven’t heard that. But is that supposed to be a bad thing, or a good thing? You know,” said Mr Trump. “If I can help save the world from problems, I’m willing to do it.

In 2018 when the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives, the wall project was denied federal funding.

Each one of them. And I’m truly sorry to everyone I’ve hurt,” said DeAngelo. Judge Michael Bowman then handed down the “absolute maximum sentence the court is able to impose under the law” to the killer, whose brutal crimes are the subject of a gripping new documentary on Binge. DeAngelo, who has three adult daughters and grandchildren, was not arrested until 2018, three decades after the “Golden State Killer” had last struck.

Picture: Santiago Mejia/AFPSource:AFP The manhunt finally ended after investigators successfully matched DNA from crime scenes with a family genealogy database used by his relatives. “The survivors have spoken clearly -- the defendant deserves no mercy,” said the judge, to thunderous applause in the courtroom. DeAngelo’s known attacks began in 1975, initially in the Sacramento area of central California, before spreading out across the state. The spree apparently ended abruptly in 1986 with the rape and murder of an 18-year-old girl. Along the way, the meticulous masked assailant was given a number of other nicknames including the East Area Rapist, the Diamond-Knot Killer and the Original Nightstalker.

We knew the age of the case. We knew how long it took to solve. And we knew that this was the right thing to do -- so you could all be here today in your lifetime,” he told the victims and families. People listen to the sentencing hearing.

A statement read out from DeAngelo’s sister blamed their father “in part” for “mental and physical abuse” but insisted she was not “searching for an excuse for it all”. “After today’s sentencing Mr DeAngelo will never threaten our victims again,” said prosecutor Diana Becton. “He will never harm another soul.” ",news.com.au,,"August 22, 2020"

Two police officers have been shot during protests over Breonna Taylor, after a grand jury handed down a decision over the young woman’s death. ","['world', 'north america'] []","Louisville Police said two officers were shot in Louisville in Kentucky on Wednesday night. Police Chief Robert Schroeder said one officer was in surgery in a stable condition, while the other officer was alert, also in a stable condition, according to a report from KFDM. Chief Schroeder said the officers were shot after they went to an area of the city to respond to reports of shots being fired. Andy Beshear, the Governor of Kentucky, pleaded for calm in the city, saying in a video shared to social media he understood people in the city were feeling “powerful emotions”. “We know that the answer to violence is never violence and we are thinking about those two officers and their families,” Governor Beshear said. Heated protests erupted in Louisville after one of three police officers was charged for the incident involving the death of Ms Taylor, but not for her killing. A grand jury in Kentucky on Wednesday charged the single officer for shooting into neighbouring apartments, but didn’t pursue any charges against the three officers for their role in the death of Ms Taylor, 26, who was fatally shot on March 13. Officers used a no-knock search warrant to enter Ms Taylor’s home during a narcotics investigation. The warrant used was connected to a person who did not live in the home, and no drugs were discovered on the property. Ms Taylor, an emergency room technician, was shot five times by the officers, Jonathan Mattingly, Brett Hankison and Myles Cosgrove. The grand jury announced on Wednesday, Officer Hankison had been charged with three counts of wanton endangerment over the raid of Ms Taylor’s home. The grand jury and the judge presiding over the case did not elaborate over the charges.

9,Trump to nominate new Supreme Court judge: reports,"Donald Trump has chosen a devout Catholic and mother of seven to be the new Supreme Court Justice, according to multiple reports. President Donald Trump will nominate federal appeals court Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the US Supreme Court, according to reports that cited sources familiar with the process.","['world', 'north america', 'us politics'] ['Donald Trump']","The White House has indicated in conversations that Ms Barrett was Mr Trump’s intended choice to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg but cautioned that he could still change his mind, senior Republican sources told CNN. Ms Barrett was spotted Friday at her home in South Bend, Indiana, but it’s unclear if she’s aware of Mr Trump’s intentions, CNN said. Ms Barrett is a former law clerk to late right wing Justice Antonin Scalia, and her appointment would tip the Supreme Court to a conservative majority, 6 to 3. The New York Times also reported that Mr Trump had made Ms Barrett his choice. Supreme Court nominees are often informed of their selection at the last possible moment to maintain secrecy. Trump has repeatedly said that he was going to pick a woman and make a formal announcement in the Rose Garden of the White House at 5pm Saturday. RELATED: National abortion rights threatened by new US Supreme Court appointment US President Donald Trump in Maryland on Thursday.

Picture: Julian Velasco/University of Notre Dame/AFPSource:AFP RELATED: Donald Trump refuses to commit to ‘peaceful transfer of power’ if he loses election The president said Monday that he was considering five women for the seat on the Supreme Court, including Ms Barrett and another federal appeals court judge, Barbara Lagoa. President Trump told reporters on Friday evening he had made up his mind on his Supreme Court nominee, but he refused to confirm that it was Ms Barrett. “I haven’t said that,” Mr Trump said after arriving back in DC from Florida. “I haven’t said it was her, but she is outstanding.” The commander in chief said he did not meet with Lagoa while he was in the Sunshine State. At 48, Ms Barrett would also be the youngest member of the high court and would maintain its conservative majority for decades. The revelation of Mr Trump’s reported intentions came just hours after Ginsburg’s body lay in state at the US Capitol, making her the first woman and the first Jewish person to receive the posthumous honour. Ginsburg, who died September 18 of metastatic pancreatic cancer at 87, will reportedly be buried next week in Arlington National Cemetery, next to her late husband, Marty Ginsburg, who died in 2010. The move to replace Ginsburg ahead of the November 3 election has sparked outrage from Democrats because US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) blocked then-President Barack Obama’s nomination of federal appeals Judge Merrick Garland in 2016 on grounds that it was an election year. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate and two GOP members — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine — have objected to fast-tracking Ginsburg’s replacement, but no others appear ready to break ranks. Earlier this week, Mr Trump called on Republican senators to quickly confirm whoever he nominated so the Supreme Court has a full bench of nine justices to rule on a likely legal battle over mail-in votes cast in his race against former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden. “I think this scam that the Democrats are pulling — it’s a scam,” he said Wednesday. “This scam will be before the United States Supreme Court and I think having the four-four situation is not a good situation if you get that.” In 2017, Mr Trump nominated Ms Barrett, then a Notre Dame law professor, to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, and she was confirmed by the US Senate in a near-party-line vote of 55-43. Ms Barrett was also reportedly on his shortlist to replace Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018 after the jurist announced his retirement at age 81. But Ms Barrett’s White House interview didn’t go well, NPR reported Thursday, citing a source who said she had to wear dark glasses due to a case of conjunctivitis and was “not at her best.” Mr Trump ultimately nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, who was confirmed by a narrow 50-48 margin following a gruelling, four-day hearing during which he emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that he sexually assaulted her while drunk at a party when they were teenagers. A report last year in Axios suggested Mr Trump still had big plans for Barrett, based on private comments he reportedly made to confidants while discussing Kennedy’s replacement. “I’m saving her for Ginsburg,” Mr Trump said in remarks confirmed this week by NPR.

We degrade ourselves. We degrade the very causes for which we fight. “But let’s be clear: going high does not mean putting on a smile and saying nice things when confronted by viciousness and cruelty. Going high means taking the harder path. It means scraping and clawing our way to that mountain top. “Going high means unlocking the shackles of lies and mistrust with the only thing that can truly set us free – the cold, hard truth. So let me be as honest and clear as I possibly can. “Donald Trump is the wrong President for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. “He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us.

She said the idea of a “second wave” is flawed because the spread of the virus does not seem to be seasonal, stressing that the dangers remain all year. “People are still thinking about seasons,” she told a press conference on Tuesday. “What we all need to get our heads around is this is a new virus and it is behaving, even though it is a respiratory virus, even though respiratory viruses in the past did tend to this different seasonal waves, this one is behaving differently. “There seems to be this persistent belief that summer is not a problem. “Summer is a problem. This virus likes all weathers, but what it particularly likes is jumping from one person to another when we come in close contact. “So let‘s not give it that opportunity. The second wave idea, we are in the first wave. It’s going to be one big wave.” She said social distancing remains the best way to prevent transmission of the virus. “It‘s going to go up and down a bit,” she continued, “Now, the best thing is to flatten it and turn it into just something lapping at your feet. “The season does not seem to be affecting the transmission of this virus currently. “What is affecting the transmission of this virus is mass gatherings, it is people coming together and people not social distancing, not talking the precautions to ensure they are not in close contact.” ",news.com.au,,"July 31, 2020"

WARNING: Graphic. WARNING: Graphic content.","['world', 'north america'] []","A man has been arrested after a woman’s dismembered body parts were discovered in pieces of his luggage, police have alleged. The man, Melvin Martin Jr, had taken a five hour bus trip from Louisville in Kentucky to Chicago, Illinois, to visit family. However his relatives became suspicious when Mr Martin became protective of his bags, according to WDRB. When he left to take a trip to the library on Tuesday, his family members made the horrific discovery, police said. Local outlets reported Markham Police spent Tuesday at the home in Markham. The Markham Police Chief, Terry White, said Mr Martin had transported body parts of his girlfriend, 31, from the Greyhound bus station in Louisville Kentucky to downtown Chicago, Illinois. Chief Martin said Mr Martin had told officers he wanted to still “be with her”. “He indicated that, as grotesque as it might sound, he still wanted to be with her. At least part of her,” Chief White said. Louisville based news anchor Fallon Glick called the case “disturbing”.

He’d reportedly made the bus trip with “two or three” separate pieces of heavy luggage. “There were some early reports of foul odour coming from the bags,” Chief White said. Louisville Police haven’t confirmed the body parts in the suitcases are linked to a crime they believe occurred in Kentucky — however reports said the evidence could be linked to a woman who was reported missing in Louisville last week. Louisville Metro Police also confirmed they’ve since discovered a homicide scene in the Clifton Heights neighbourhood, after receiving a tip from the Markham Police Department. Mr Martin was arrested at the library, according to Markham Police Chief White, who said the accused was “remorseful”. ",news.com.au,,"September 17, 2020"
17,New Zealand lockdown: Stage 3 restrictions after new coronavirus cases,Jacinda Ardern has shut down a virus theory that’s been circulating ever since New Zealand reported four new cases. Jacinda Ardern has sought to silence a rumour that New Zealand authorities knew about the country’s new virus cases much earlier than when they revealed it.,"['world', 'coronavirus', 'global'] ['Jacinda Ardern', 'coronavirus']","“I’ve had suggestion that we may have had this information earlier than we said,” she said during a press conference today. “We would never do that. I do worry that those kinds of theories do nothing to help us.” The New Zealand Prime Minister said she went to a public event at 3.15pm yesterday and was first informed of the new case afterwards at 4pm. She said she immediately spoke to her Chief of Staff and the New Zealand Health Minister. Dr Ashley Bloomfield, a public health official, said he was informed of the virus just before 3pm yesterday, and spent the rest of the afternoon gathering information. “We needed to have a certain amount of information to be able to inform what are quite significant decisions in moving Auckland to level 3 restrictions, and the rest of the country to level 2,” he said. THREE COLLEAGUES OF CASE SHOWING SYMPTOMS  Three colleagues of one of the newly-infected people in New Zealand have been isolated after showing symptoms of COVID-19, in a worrying sign the virus could spread further. Ms Ardern and Dr Bloomfield said the new case’s workplace has been closed while contact tracing gets underway. “The person only has one close contact in a small team but we are treating everybody in the workplace, which has now been shut down,” Dr Bloomfield said. “It has been shut down and all are being followed up and tested. That follow up will happen from the national contact tracing centre here in Wellington. “There are three of the husband or the partner‘s colleagues who are symptomatic and being tested, isolated and their households are in isolation as well. That workplace is in four sites across Auckland with a total of around 160 staff. They are all shut down and there is both testing of all those who work there. “I should add that we are also doing genome sequencing on all those who have tested positive and our recent cases and current cases in managed isolation and quarantine.” New Zealand is urgently returning to lockdown after four new coronavirus cases within the same family were confirmed in Auckland. The cases have no known source and authorities are working to figure out where the family contracted coronavirus. NEW ZEALAND RETURNS TO LOCKDOWN  Ms Ardern announced Auckland would return to stage three restrictions for three days starting from midday (10am AEST) on Wednesday. She said all aged care facilities will close their doors to everyone but staff and essential deliveries from midday local time. She also urged everyone to wear masks to help prevent the spread of the virus, noting people can fashion their own face covering if needed. Ms Ardern said she has one “special request” - that people don’t get tested unnecessarily. “If you have any symptoms, or if a medical professional or health line recommend you are tested, then please get tested. If you have no symptoms and if you don‘t work in MIQ… and you are perfectly healthy and well, then, please, just comply with the requirements around level two restrictions in Auckland.” On the country’s upcoming election, which is due to take place on September 19, Ms Ardern said no decisions have been made, noting authorities are “still in the very early stages” of working through that. Dr Bloomfield today said the family are still in isolation and authorities are still working with them on what quarantine facility they might go into. One of the cases, a woman in her 20s, travelled to Rotorua - a popular tourist city in the North Island - while symptomatic. Authorities are working to find out what places the family might have visited over the weekend. There are now testing sites available in the area. “A reminder once again that this virus does not discriminate,” Dr Bloomfield said. “We want to find the virus, and we will, as we are with this family, with anyone who has it, to ensure that their health and wellbeing are looked after and we stop it spreading further in the community.” An alert was sent to New Zealanders’ phones on Tuesday night announcing people of the virus. The rest of the country will return to stage two for thee days until midnight Friday. “I know this information will be difficult to receive,” Ms Ardern said last night. “We had all hoped not to find ourselves in this position again but we had also prepared for it.” Ms Ardern said people in Auckland would have to wear a mask when accessing essential services, while people in the rest of the country would have to don face coverings when social distancing was not possible.

NEW CASES SPARK SUPERMARKET PANIC-BUYING  Countdown supermarkets are moving to immediately restrict the sale of some essential products to ensure demand can be met and prevent stockpiling. The news of a return to lockdown conditions sparked scenes of panic buying on Tuesday night, with calls for calm from Auckland’s mayor Phil Goff. “I understand that people are probably feeling a little bit scared, a little angry and a little confused right now. None of us wanted to go back into a lockdown, but we always knew this was a very real possibility,” he said. “I am urging Aucklanders to come together like we did last time to stamp out community transmission. Please remain calm, please do not panic buy and please follow the lockdown rules. “Please follow Ministry of Health advice around good hygiene practices and social distancing. If you have symptoms, please make sure you get tested and avoid contact with others. “We beat community transmission once and we can do again, but that requires all of us to work as a team. “Like last time, more details will be forthcoming over the next little while, so please keep updated through news channel and official government websites,” said Goff. Retail NZ CEO Greg Harford told the New Zealand Herald the lockdown was devastating for a struggling sector and another nail in the coffin for many businesses. “The retail sector has been struggling to recover from the effects of the earlier lockdowns, and spending since March is still down nearly 10 per cent,” Harford said. “A further lockdown has the potential to be catastrophic for struggling businesses, and Retail NZ is hoping that the new lockdown will be lifted quickly once the full situation is known and managed.” Jacinda Ardern announces the return of coronavirus.Source:Supplied NO CONNECTION TO OVERSEAS TRAVEL The cases had no connection to overseas travel. The first case confirmed was a person in their 50s who presented to their GP with symptoms yesterday. The man had strong symptoms including a fever and a cough, and the man’s partner also had strong symptoms, Dr Bloomfield said. There were five days from symptom onset until they were tested, he said, which was why close contacts were being followed up. TVNZ reported the man works the night shift at a business and three of his colleagues are waiting for their test results. His wife works in a central Auckland suburb and was tested at a West Auckland GP which is now closed. New Zealand Health Minister Chris Hipkins noted work colleagues of one of the family members were also showing symptoms, with reports at least two colleagues are affected so far. One of the children attends Mt Albert Primary School, which has been closed for 72 hours. Officials are awaiting the child’s test results. Ms Ardern said more information would be shared, but privacy issues needed to be considered. Dr Bloomfield said authorities sprung into action and tested the rest of the family. Of the six other family members tested, three were positive and the others returned negative results. They remain in their home for now but Ms Ardern said moving them to a quarantine facility was being considered. He said close contacts were being tested and had gone into self-isolation. Casual contacts have also gone into self-isolation. Dr Bloomfield said it was inevitable the virus was going to return to the country. “This is a tricky virus,” he said. “The cases are a wake up call for any complacency that may have set in. The important thing now is that we stop the spread of the virus in the community. We need to stamp it out.” RELATED: Best reusable face masks to buy Ms Ardern said more than one workplace was involved and it was likely it wasn’t just one suburb alone in Auckland affected. She said the most important thing to do was find the origin of the cases. “There is no immediate link we have found, as yet, to a managed isolation facility, and there is no connection to a high risk person, such as those who work at the border,” she said. Workers at the border are also being tested. RETURN OF RESTRICTIONS Those in Auckland will have to work from home unless they are an essential service worker. Schools will only open for students who have parents who are essential workers. Public facilities, bars, restaurants and businesses must close by midday Wednesday. People can only leave the house for essential services and gatherings of more than 10 people are restricted. For the rest of the country, mass gatherings will be limited to 100 people. Ms Ardern said the three-day restrictions would give authorities time to assess the situation. “We’re asking people in Auckland to stay home to stop the spread,” she said. “Act as if you have COVID, and as though people around you have COVID. “We have come too far to go backwards.” Queues of cars wait outside a testing centre on June 17 in Auckland. Picture: Phil Walter/Getty ImagesSource:Getty Images EARLY SUCCESS STORY Australia rejoiced when New Zealand declared it had no active coronavirus cases on June 8 because it meant a trans-Tasman travel bubble would become more likely. The country lifted all coronavirus restrictions except its international border control. Eliminating coronavirus in the community was something most health experts thought was impossible. The first case of coronavirus in New Zealand was confirmed on February 28 and the government enacted its pandemic response plan. On March 26, the country entered a total lockdown. Schools were closed, all non-essential businesses were shutdown, people had to work from home, travel was restricted and social gatherings of any kind were banned. Ms Ardern declared a national emergency, giving authorities new powers to enforce the strict control measures. Kiwis essentially went inside their homes and didn’t venture out again for four long weeks. It was a bold strategy that represented the strongest response to the COVID-19 pandemic almost anywhere in the world. NEW ZEALAND REACTS People were quick to react to the news tonight coronavirus had returned to the country, with most welcoming the return of restrictions. Many said they were thankful for their fact acting government, praising Ms Ardern for her swift response. “Jacinda is not messing around,” they wrote on Twitter. While Ms Ardern warned people not to race to supermarkets, people are already reporting huge line ups.

RELATED: Follow our live coronavirus coverage Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced the country has registered a coronavirus vaccine. Picture: Alexei Druzhinin/AFPSource:AFP The vaccine was developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute and had less than two months of human testing. There had been calls for Russia to put off registering the vaccine until its trials were complete. Mass production is expected to start in September and mass vaccination in October. The institute launched phase three trials for its vaccine last week which will involve thousands of volunteers. The drug is a so-called viral vector vaccine, meaning it employs another virus to carry the DNA encoding the necessary immune response into cells. It is based on the adenovirus, the common cold. Russian frontline health workers will be the first citizens offered a chance to receive the vaccination, a source told Reuters. There are currently more than 100 COVID-19 vaccines in development around the world, with at least four being in the final stages of human trials. Meanwhile, earlier today Opposition health spokesman Chris Bowen said Australia is not doing enough to help develop a coronavirus vaccine. Mr Bowen told Sky News on Tuesday that Australia was “way behind in the queue” for a vaccine. He said other countries, including Japan, had already signed multiple supply agreements for vaccines that might work. “We haven’t signed one,” Mr Bowen said. RELATED: Grim prediction for Australia’s outbreak The Federal Government has given $5 million to the University of Queensland for one potential vaccine, which has also received $10 million from the Queensland Government. But Mr Bowen said the nation should be spending more on vaccine development. “We need to have our eggs in more than one basket … but the Federal Governments has just chosen one and the result of that is that we are way behind in the queue to get the vaccine for Australians,” Mr Bowen said. “You’ve got to be in the discussions, you’ve got to be signing the deals, you’ve got to be funding the research.” The call for greater investment comes as Australia investigates its ability to find a possible COVID-19 vaccine and manufacture it onshore. Documents published this week show the Federal Government is seeking “early access” to safe and effective coronavirus vaccines and treatments as soon as they’re available. Prime Minister Scott Morrison publicly called on any country that finds a vaccine to share it, pledging Australia will do the same. Tender documents reveal a government audit of its onshore “capacity and capability” to add to existing research and help inform the manufacturing of possible COVID-19 vaccine and treatment is now under way. The Government is seeking information from organisations already regulated or likely to seek regulation through the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Respondents must answer questions about their commercial vaccine and treatment manufacturing capability and onshore capacity. Manufacturers’ willingness to repurpose their businesses to support the manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments for the Australian population is also being sought. Organisations with the ability to manufacture the drug in Australia are also asked to provide details about packaging and transporting and storing vaccines and consumables. The Government says the details will be used to inform decisions and identify feasible opportunities for COVID-19 vaccine and treatments manufacturing. Early in the pandemic, experts warned that Australia lacked vaccine-making capacity. ",news.com.au,,"August 12, 2020"

22,Coronavirus Australia: Melbourne now world’s strictest lockdown,"Melbourne now has to endure some of the toughest COVID rules in the world. Here’s how other countries and cities compare.  Melburnians now endure some of the strictest lockdown conditions in the world, as the Victorian government battles to contain hundreds of new coronavirus infections every day.","['world', 'coronavirus', 'global'] ['coronavirus']","Many countries that were initially hit hard by the deadly virus are now reopening for the sake of rebuilding their economies, with social gathering limits dropped and dining establishments reopened. Others, which had early success in containing the virus, are now being forced into secondary lockdowns due to infections rising beyond control. Still, other leaders whose countries have skyrocketing infections and death tolls are refusing to implement lockdowns. Here’s how Melbourne compares. MELBOURNE’S ‘DEVASTATING’ RESTRICTIONS Under Melbourne’s strict new rules, residents are only allowed to leave the house for one of four essential reasons – shopping for groceries and essential items; medical needs and caregiving; daily exercise in your local area; and work where it’s not possible to do so from home. A citywide curfew has been implemented from 8pm to 5am every day, meaning everyone has to stay at home during those hours. Exercise is limited to one hour, once per day, and must take place within five kilometres of home. Mask-wearing is mandatory, including in regional Victoria, and all restaurants and cafes are closed for dining in. Schools will return to remote learning, religious services will need to be broadcast online, weddings will no longer be permitted from August 6, and funerals will be limited to 10 people. The new phase of restrictions is expected to trigger an estimated 250,000 job losses with Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chief Executive Paul Guerra describing the projected effect as “devastating and long-lasting. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews himself described the unfolding situation as “heartbreaking” when declaring the need for the city’s shutdown.

Picture: Jason EdwardsSource:News Corp Australia WESTERN EUROPE Several countries in western Europe suffered harsh first waves of COVID-19, when the virus first broke out there at the end of January. Italy, which was the first European country to be devastated by the virus, introduced a strict lockdown from March 9 that saw the closure of all shops, restaurants, cinemas and gyms. In the worst-hit region, Lombardy, outdoor exercise was banned and temperature checks were mandatory at supermarkets and pharmacies. But over the past couple of months, Italy, Spain, Germany, Belgium and France have all reopened in varying degrees. In each of these countries, restaurants, bars and cafes have reopened at varying degrees – while schools at all age levels have reopened with mandatory attendance. The United Kingdom, which is among the world’s worst-hit countries to date, reopened shops and retail in June. Pubs, restaurants and hotels reopened last month, and indoor concerts were allowed to resume earlier this week. The city of Leicester went into its own specific lockdown, but as of this week, pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants across the city have been allowed to reopen. Diners sit at tables outside a restaurant in London on August 3, 2020, as the Government's ""Eat out to Help out"" coronavirus scheme gets underway. Picture: Tolga Akmen/AFPSource:AFP CHINA China initially had extremely strict lockdown measures, particularly for the 60 million residents living in the country’s central Hubei province, where the virus first broke out. Residents were locked down for nearly 80 days. Transport in and out of Wuhan was cut. People were ordered to stay at home unless they needed to buy groceries or seek medical care – rules similar to the Stage 4 lockdown currently employed in Melbourne. Since June, the country has taken huge steps to reopen businesses. However, a unique so-called “wartime” lockdown has more recently been imposed on the 3.5 million residents living in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, in the country’s northwest. After the city recorded six infections in two days, authorities locked down all residential communities, banned people from leaving their housing compounds, suspended public transport services and banned public gatherings. Citizens in Xinjiang have already been under strict control, with more than one million Uighurs detained in “re-education” camps, and a heavy surveillance presence across the region. China as a whole is no longer in the top 20 countries leading COVID-related infections or deaths, although the Chinese government’s official figures have long been disputed by experts. UNITED STATES The United States has recorded the world’s highest number of coronavirus infections and deaths. The lockdown measures implemented to tackle the pandemic varied from state to state. New York, the original epicentre of the virus, saw a statewide stay-at-home order implemented in late March. All non-essential businesses were ordered to close and non-essential workers were made to stay home. The state has since reopened its restaurants, cafes and clubs, and the virus has now grown exponentially in other states such as Florida, Texas and California. It took Florida from March until late June to reach 100,000 cases, but only took two weeks to double that figure. Authorities temporarily closed beaches, reimposed curfews, closed establishments and made face masks mandatory – before abruptly backtracking and allowing gyms and outdoor dining to continue operating. In California, a stay-at-home order has been issued for all residents unless they are going to work, exercising, running errands or shopping for essential needs. But retailers, including libraries, drive-in theatres, jewellery stores and florists have been permitted to stay open. The coronavirus pandemic has not put people off going to the beach in Florida.

This new lockdown mirrors that of Melbourne. It will see some businesses and public transport closed, while work and quarantine passes will be required. Businesses that had previously been allowed to open – hairdressers, internet cafes, gyms, restaurants, tattoo parlours, cinemas and tourist destinations – will again be made to close, and police will patrol the streets to ensure the lockdown measures are abided by. In mid-March, Duterte imposed one of the world‘s longest and strictest lockdowns in the capital and other provinces to curb the coronavirus spread. He began easing restrictions in June in an effort to revive the domestic economy, which is now facing its biggest contraction in more than three decades.

The country’s 1.3 billion people were abruptly ordered to stay indoors from March 25, which saw nearly 40 million migrant labourers in jeopardy, and many starving. Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the public fewer than four hours’ notice before the three-week lockdown began. On June 8, the country began to loosen its restrictions, with restaurants, offices, shopping centres and places of worship permitted to reopen. Domestic flights through India resumed in late May. India imposed the world’s largest lockdown back in March, but some businesses have since reopened. Picture: Xavier GALIANASource:AFP ISRAEL A few weeks ago, Israel was forced to reimpose further lockdown measures following a vigorous second surge of the virus, which saw daily infection rates climbing close to 2000. The country’s new restrictions saw gyms and fitness studios closed down, while restaurants would only be open for takeaway and deliveries. More than 100 schools have been forced to close. The country also imposed a new weekend restrictions limiting gatherings and leisure activities, including beach attendance. The new lockdowns have seen citizens taking to the streets in protest against the Israeli government’s pandemic response. That said, the country’s lockdown measures are not as strict as Melbourne’s. Israel has no specific curfew, and indoor gatherings of people from multiple households are still permitted, with a limit of 10 people or less. BRAZIL Brazil has emerged as a new coronavirus hotspot, with the second-highest number of infections in the world, behind only the United States. Despite this, stay-at-home orders and lockdown measures are minimal, with the country’s far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro downplaying the pandemic. Mr Bolsonaro, who tested positive for COVID-19 last month, routinely argues that lockdown measures have “killed” and “suffocated” the country’s economy. VIETNAM On July 25, Vietnam was hit by a series of new cases that marked the end of a 99-day virus-free streak. Hundreds of cases have since emerged in the country, largely in the region surrounding the coastal city of Da Nang. Partial lockdown measures have been implemented since. Movement was banned in and out of the coastal city, and entertainment venues were closed. However, the country has no plans for a widespread lockdown and will only put areas considered serious epicentres under strict quarantine, the government said. “We will only implement social distancing in areas considered virus epicentres, and will not pursue a widespread lockdown,” Mai Tien Dung, the government’s spokesman, told a monthly press conference on Monday. Vietnam has been hit by hundreds of cases in the past two weeks.

New South Wales currently allows gatherings of up to 20 people. Contact sports have resumed, restaurants and pubs have reopened with seating limits. Weddings and corporate events have opened with limits of 150 people, while funerals and places of worship are limited to 100 people. Social distancing measures must be observed at all events. In Queensland, up to 100 adults from different households are allowed to visit another home or gather in public spaces, restaurants and other establishments have been reopened with social distancing limits, and travel throughout the state is unrestricted. The remaining states and territories have even fewer and less harsh restrictions, although physical distancing is encouraged, and there are limits on the number of residents allowed in aged care homes at a time. But now, Victoria’s outbreak is sending other states into panic. Yesterday, both South Australia and Tasmania announced changes as Victoria’s case numbers continue to remain high.

Westpac chief executive Peter King said the bank’s results were “disappointing”, noting high costs during an economic decline has weighed on its performance. “2020 has been a particularly challenging year and our financial result is disappointing,” Mr King said.

Authorities in Qatar say they have identified a woman who allegedly dumped her newborn baby in a bathroom bin at Doha Airport, which sparked the “disturbing” strip search of Australian travellers. ","['travel', 'travel updates', 'incidents'] []","They said police officers at the airport, who ordered the physical examination of female travellers as part of the search for the abandoned baby’s mother, have also been charged over the October 2 incident. Prosecutors said the woman was an “Asian national” and “fugitive convict” who allegedly texted the child’s father when she abandoned the child and then flew out of Qatar. She has been charged with attempted murder and faces 15 years in jail. Her exact location is unknown and authorities are still in the process of arresting her, the ABC reported. The newborn girl was found alive and taken into medical care in Doha. Prosecutors said DNA testing had also identified the child’s father but he has not been charged. “The mother, while leaving the country, threw the newborn infant in the trash can in one of the toilets in the Departures Lounge at the Airport and boarded the plane to her destination,” a statement from prosecutors said, according to Al Jazeera.  Footage from the airport shows the moment the child was recovered from the bathroom. Picture: Doha News ExclusiveSource:Supplied “The father of the infant admitted that he had a relationship with the infant’s mother, and that she had sent him a message and a photo of the newborn infant immediately after her birth. “The letter included her saying that she had thrown (away) the infant she had given birth to and fled to her country. Examining the DNA of the defendants were identical to that of the infant.” Sex and childbirth outside marriage is illegal in Qatar, as in much of the Middle East. The discovery of the child at Doha’s Hamad International Airport on October 2 sparked an international incident as at least 18 female travellers, including 13 Australians, were subjected to invasive physical examinations in the desperate search for her mother. Australian women told of their fear as they were pulled off flights and rounded up for the invasive checks. Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne described the incident as “grossly disturbing” and demanded answers from Qatari authorities. The newborn girl was taken into the care of medical workers.

Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al Thani has apologised to the women involved. “We regret the unacceptable treatment of the female passengers at (Hamad International Airport),” he said last month. “I assure you that we will hold those responsible for these acts to account. What took place does not represent Qatar’s laws or values. We will undertake all measures to prevent a recurrence.” The Qatar Government has said officials at the airport who ordered the physical checks of female travellers had been charged and are facing up to three years in jail. One of the Australian women strip searched at Doha airport told 60 Minutes on Sunday she had been left traumatised by the experience. The woman, identified as Jane, told the program she and her husband were on a Qatar Airways plane due to depart for Sydney when the group of women – 13 who were Australian – were told to get their passports and get off the flight.

Australia’s unemployment rate has fallen to 6.8 per cent, with 90,000 new workers finding jobs during the month of November. ","['finance', 'work'] []","Latest labour data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveals the majority of new jobs were picked up in Victoria, with the southern state adding 74,000 new positions. The participation rate – the number of people employed or looking for a job – increased by 0.3 per cent over the month. Unemployment numbers dropped by 17,300 people. The fall comes after a slight increase in unemployment in October to 7 per cent, with 25,500 people over the period becoming jobless. ABS head of labour statistics Bjorn Jarvis said there were still 138,000 fewer people employed since March and 226,000 Australians unemployed in that time. “Early in the COVID period we saw large flows of people out of the labour force – 666,000 people between March and May – and the participation rate fell 3.3 percentage points over the two months,” Mr Jarvis said. Mr Jarvis noted Victoria’s labour market was catching up with the rest of the country. Picture: Daniel Pockett/ Getty ImagesSource:Getty Images Mr Jarvis noted Victoria’s labour market was catching up with the rest of the country following the easing of shutdown measures in the southern state. “The gap between Victoria and the rest of Australia has narrowed considerably since September off the back of two consecutive months of strong recovery in employment and hours,” he said. “Hours worked in Victoria also recovered strongly again, increasing by 5.2 per cent, following an increase of 5.6 per cent in October.” CommSec senior economist Ryan Felsman said while the drop was positive, the coronavirus pandemic had scarred the labour market, with roughly 942,100 Australians still out of work. The number of Australians out of work peaked in July with more than a million people actively looking for work. Mr Felsman said unemployment might have already peaked in July at 7.5 per cent. CommSec senior economist Ryan Felsman says unemployment may have already peaked. Picture: supplied.Source:Supplied “Government intervention via wage subsidies – such as JobKeeper – prevented a huge lift in the jobless rate when compared to the large contraction in economic activity in the June quarter,” Mr Felsman said. “But the healing has just begun with the unemployment rate unlikely to fall back to pre-recession levels for at least 12 months or more.” Employment Minister Michaelia Cash said the government was “acutely aware” that the economic and labour market fallout from COVID-19 will continue for some time. “That is why the Morrison Government has committed an unprecedented $507 billion in economic support, to help rebuild the economy and put Australia back on the road to recovery,” Senator Cash said. Aside from Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania have the highest state levels of unemployment at 7.7 per cent and 7.9 per cent respectively. NSW’s unemployment level sits at 6.5 per cent, while the Australian Capital Territory has the lowest jobless rate at 4 per cent. ANZ economists believed unemployment would remain at 7 per cent. More Australians found work last month. Picture: NCA NewsWire / James GourleySource:News Corp Australia “We expect Australia’s labour market data to show employment to have risen 70k, driven by Victoria, but higher participation should see unemployment steady at 7 per cent,” ANZ said in a statement on Thursday morning. Westpac also anticipated the rate to remain flat but noted the participation rate in Victoria would rise higher than other states. Australia’s unemployment rate has sharply risen over 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic; however, the hit to the jobless rate has not been as bad as first anticipated due to a faster economic recovery and federal government support measures such as JobKeeper, which has kept workers employed. The Reserve Bank of Australia initially tipped unemployment to rise to 10 per cent but revised its predictions downwards to a peak rate at just below 8 per cent. The RBA and the federal government have both flagged fiscal stimulus support will need to continue while the unemployment rate is higher than 6 per cent. RBA governor Philip Lowe said unemployment was not expected to dip below 6 per cent until the end of 2022. However, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has a longer outlook. “The unemployment rate is expected to recover to pre-COVID levels in around four years,” he said. “This compares to around six years for the 1980s recession and 10 years for the 1990s recession.” Labor leader Anthony Albanese said it was always good news when people are able to find work. But he said lots of people were underemployed. “You are counted as being employed if you’re doing a couple of hours; what we need to do is to make sure that we have strategies which boost full-time employment,” he said.

Rolando said Angelica didn’t say anything when they hauled her on to the deck and was so weak he believed she would have drowned if she had spent any longer in the sea. “So it turns out that I didn’t catch any fish that day either, but I fished a life. I think this was God’s purpose.” Mystery continues to surround exactly what happened during that time with her account of fleeing domestic abuse at the hands of her partner disputed by her daughter. Angelica says that after living rough then being forced to leave a refuge, she decided to take her own life and threw herself into the sea. “For 20 years I had a toxic relationship,” she told RCN radio. “The abuse began in the first pregnancy, he beat me, he violently abused me. Angelica was found off Colombia’s Atlantic coast.

In September 2018 he broke my face and tried to kill me. Thank God I managed to escape.” She lived rough in the city of Barranquilla for six months before she sought help and was housed in a shelter. But she was reportedly forced to leave because her partner was no longer living in the city, which sent her into a deep depression. ”I did not want to continue with my life.

She said she doesn’t remember much more as she slipped into unconsciousness. ”The man who rescued me in the middle of the sea told me that I was unconscious, floating,” Angelica said. “Thank God I was alive, and he threw me a life preserver. They brought me to a health centre where I am receiving the necessary care.” According to La Libertad, her family said they last heard from her in 2018 when she left to go to Ecuador to live with her brother.

Local media tracked down the woman’s daughter Alejandra Castiblanco who said she had not known about her mum’s whereabouts for the past two years. She appeared to contradict Angelica’s story, saying her father had never been abusive to her and that he has never lived in Barranquilla. “We don’t know who attacked her, or how she ended up in the sea,” said Alejandra. She said that her mother suffered from heart problems for years, and that after a heart attack her mental health had deteriorated. Alejandra and her sister are currently raising money to bring their mum to the capital Bogota where they live and hope she will now be “taken care of by family”.

32,Portland shooting: Donald Trump supporter shot dead in clash with BLM protesters,"With “lawlessness” rampant on America’s streets, President Donald Trump has decided who is to blame – and he isn’t holding back. US President Donald Trump and his election opponent, Joe Biden, are trading insults and accusations amid escalating violence in the country’s cities.","['world', 'north america', 'us politics'] ['Donald Trump', 'Joe Biden']","But Mr Biden is not the only target of Mr Trump’s ire. Yesterday, a man believed to be a supporter of the President was shot dead during confrontations between a caravan of pro-Trump demonstrators and Black Lives Matter protesters in Portland, Oregon. The caravan included about 600 vehicles. Mr Trump has praised the participants, calling them “great patriots”. GREAT PATRIOTS! https://t.co/BWGxVoBTmI Footage from Portland showed the two groups clashing on the streets, with the Black Lives Matter supporters throwing water bottles and other projectiles at the caravan, which responded by firing paintballs and pepper spray. Police responded to reports of gunfire at 8:46pm on Saturday, local time, and found a man with a gunshot wound to his chest. A homicide investigation is now under way. The victim was wearing a hat with the insignia for Patriot Prayer, a far-right group which frequently protests in support of Mr Trump. “It is still early in this investigation, and I ask everyone to give the detectives time to do their important work before drawing conclusions about what took place,” Police Chief Chuck Lovell said. “This violence is completely unacceptable and we are working diligently to find and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible.” He appealed to the public for information about the shooting. There have been protests against police brutality in the streets of Portland ever since the death of George Floyd in May, but they intensified a week ago after Wisconsin police repeatedly shot an African-American man, Jacob Blake, in the back. The protests have sometimes descended into rioting, vandalism and violence. RELATED: Trump settles on ‘law and order’ election strategy Portland police dispersing a crowd after protesters set fire to the Portland Police Association (PPA) building. Picture: Nathan HowardSource:AFP A protester walking past a dumpster fire. Picture: Nathan HowardSource:AFP TRUMP HAMMERS ‘LAW AND ORDER’ MESSAGE President Trump made “law and order” one of the dominant themes of the Republican National Convention last week. He argues the rioting is a result of weak leadership from Democratic Party politicians, including local mayors, state governors, and Mr Biden. “No one will be safe in Biden’s America,” the President warned during his speech at the White House on Friday AEST. “Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund police departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon.” Since that speech, Mr Trump has continued to take potshots on Twitter, focusing much of his anger on Portland’s Democratic Mayor, Ted Wheeler. “The big backlash going on in Portland cannot be unexpected after 95 days of watching an incompetent Mayor admit that he has no idea what he is doing,” he said overnight. “The people of Portland won’t put up with no safety any longer. The Mayor is a FOOL. Bring in the National Guard!” LAW & ORDER!!! Last week, Mr Wheeler rejected Mr Trump’s offer to send in federal law enforcement. He responded to the President’s criticism during a media conference today. “The President of the United States is somebody who has been perpetrating divisive and hateful language for four years. For him to now stand here and say that it’s unexpected and act as though he is shocked is appalling to me,” Mr Wheeler said. “The tweets that he has been putting out in the last 48 hours attacking Democratic mayors, attacking those who are trying to bring resolution to the violence in their local communities – he has an opportunity to uplift us and bring us together and help us move through this difficult situation in our nation’s history. “Instead, he chooses to play petty politics and divide us. “I’m going to do the work I need to do here in my local community, with my local officials, to take accountability for what’s happening in our streets. And I’d appreciate that either the President support us, or stay the hell out of the way.” Mr Wheeler conceded it was “no secret” that he does not like Mr Trump, but he would “defend to the death the right of a Trump supporter to stand outside my apartment and nonviolently demonstrate”. “When people say they want to come intot he city in a caravan supporting their presidential candidate, we cannot tell them no. They have constitutional rights to be here, rights which I embrace and support. The violence, however, is the problem.” Ted Wheeler, the wacky Radical Left Do Nothing Democrat Mayor of Portland, who has watched great death and destruction of his City during his tenure, thinks this lawless situation should go on forever. Wrong! Portland will never recover with a fool for a Mayor.... ..The people of Portland, like all other cities &  parts of our great Country, want Law & Order. The Radical Left Democrat Mayors, like the dummy running Portland, or the guy right now in his basement unwilling to lead or even speak out against crime, will never be able to do it! The “guy in his basement” Mr Trump referred to there is Mr Biden. The President is planning to visit the other major site of unrest at the moment – Kenosha, Wisconsin, where Mr Blake was shot – on Tuesday, US time. He intends to meet with law enforcement. It is unclear where he will speak with Mr Blake’s family. The protests in Kenosha have also resulted in violence and death. Last week, 17-year-old white teenager Kyle Rittenhouse shot three demonstrators with a semiautomatic rifle, and killed two of them. He has been charged with first-degree homicide. Mr Rittenhouse’s lawyers say he only acted in self-defence. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, today urged Mr Trump to “reconsider” his planned visit to the state. “I, along with other community leaders who have reached out, am concerned about what your presence will mean for Kenosha and our state,” Mr Evers said in a letter to the White House. “I am concerned your presence will only hinder our healing. I am concerned your presence will only delay our work to overcome division and move forward together.” President Trump at a rally in New Hampshire on Friday, US time. Picture: Spencer Platt/Getty Images/AFPSource:AFP BIDEN CONDEMNS VIOLENCE, BLAMES TRUMP Republicans have been pressuring Mr Biden to denounce the rioting – which he has done several times now. The Democratic presidential nominee will give a speech in Pennsylvania tomorrow addressing the violence. And in an unusually aggressive statement issued today, he slammed Mr Trump. “The deadly violence we saw overnight in Portland is unacceptable. Shooting in the streets of a great American city is unacceptable,” Mr Biden said. “I condemn this violence unequivocally. I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same. “It does not matter if you find the political views of your opponents abhorrent, any loss of life is a tragedy. Today there is another family grieving in America, and Jill and I offer our deepest condolences. “We must not become a country at war with ourselves. A country that accepts the killing of fellow Americans who do not agree with you. A country that vows vengeance towards one another. “But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be, the America he believes we are.” He accused the President of “fanning the flames” and “recklessly encouraging” violence. “We must condemn the incitement of hate and resentment that led to this deadly clash. It is not a peaceful protest when you go out spoiling for a fight,” he said. “What does President Trump think will happen when he continues to insist on fanning the flames of hate and division in our society, and using the politics of fear to whip up his supporters? He is recklessly encouraging violence. “He may believe tweeting about law and order makes him strong, but his failure to call on his supporters to stop seeking conflict shows just how weak he is. He may think that war in our streets is good for his re-election chances, but that is not presidential leadership, or even basic human compassion. “The job of a president is to lower the temperature. To bring people who disagree with one another together. To make life better for all Americans, not just those who agree with us, support us, or vote for us. “Donald Trump has been President for almost four years. The temperature in the country is higher, tensions run stronger, divisions run deeper. And all of us are less safe because Donald Trump can’t do the job.” Once again, a Black man — Jacob Blake — was shot by the police. In front of his children. It makes me sick.Is this the country we want to be?Needless violence won’t heal us. We need to end the violence — and peacefully come together to demand justice. pic.twitter.com/WdNqrxA3PK Mr Biden was also interviewed about the subject by MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell last week, the day after Vice President Mike Pence’s speech to the Republican convention. That speech, like Mr Trump’s the next day, focused heavily on law and order. “(Pence) said that Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to violence in America’s cities, adding that, ‘The hard truth is, you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.’ Your response to that?” Mitchell asked. “You know, he said – yes, Joe Biden’s America. While running a video of Donald Trump’s America,” said Mr Biden. No video was playing while Mr Pence spoke. The convention did include footage of violence, particularly in one video compilation warning viewers about “Biden’s America”. “This is a taste of Biden’s America. The rioting, the crime,” a voiceover said. The footage in that clip actually came from a protest in Barcelona, Spain last year. “The problem we have right now is we’re in Donald Trump’s America,” Mr Biden continued. “He views this as a political benefit to him. You know, he’s rooting for more violence, not less. And let’s be clear about that. “And what’s he doing? He’s pouring gasoline on the fire. This happens to be Donald Trump’s America.

New Zealanders will be heading to the polls on October 17 this year, after an outbreak of coronavirus in the country led to the government delaying the election by just under a month. The selfie included at least 17 people including Ms Ardern, none of whom were wearing masks. Under current restrictions, New Zealanders are supposed to keep two metres distance to stop the spread of COVID-19. But Ms Ardern was mobbed by supporters while leaving the university, and after reportedly asking for space, she acquiesced and took the selfie with the group.

The trial begins in Brisbane’s Federal Circuit Court on Monday. Maurice Blackburn Lawyers and the Together Union have brought the legal action against Flight Centre on behalf of five former workers who claim they were robbed of pay and entitlements totalling more than $200,000. The legal firm and the union said potentially thousands of current and former Flight Centre workers could be owed money under the pay structure, a target-based incentive scheme primarily made up of commissions. When the court action was filed in April last year, Flight Centre “categorically denied” the allegations.The company has since adopted a new enterprise agreement and changed the pay structure. Maurice Blackburn and the Together Union have brought the legal action against Flight Centre. Picture: Glenn Hunt/AAPSource:AAP Maurice Blackburn principal Giri Sivaraman said Flight Centre’s old pay structure was a complex system of commissions and top-ups that allegedly undercut the basic entitlements workers required under Australian law. “This system was without a doubt double-dipping by Flight Centre,” Mr Sivaraman said. “Flight Centre for years operated a dubious system that enabled them to use the same sum of money paid to workers for two different purposes. They ran a target-based incentive scheme for sales staff that paid commissions and then pointed to these same commissions to argue that they were meeting basic award requirements.” Mr Sivaraman also noted the Fair Work Act did not allow an employer to substitute commissions for a worker’s award entitlements.

Together Union secretary Alex Scott said major companies such as Flight Centre needed to be held to account in meeting payment obligations. “Flight Centre is a massive company who for years ran a calculated and deliberate system that relied on commissions to drive down the wages of its workers,” Mr Scott said. “That system allowed Flight Centre to repeatedly pay many workers under the award. “Flight Centre is not above the law, and that’s why we are fighting this landmark case on behalf of our members – this was systemic wage theft and they must be held to account.” Flight Centre has been contacted for comment.

35,Dad jailed for ‘sadistic’ disciplining of his kids,A dad who forced his daughter to write “I am a liar” 1000 times and poured vinegar into open wounds as brutal punishment has been jailed.  WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTNET  ,"['world', 'europe'] []","A sadistic dad who forced his daughter to write “I am a liar, I’m a stealer” 1000 times as part of a brutal punishment has been jailed in the UK. Shane O’Brien, 54, subjected his children to shocking physical discipline over a two-year period, including beatings, shaving their heads and pouring vinegar into their wounds, according to the Daily Mirror. Mr O’Brien’s two children, who are now adults, told a court in Oxford the period between July 2014 and December 2016 left them feeling “less than an animal” and suffering from flashbacks. Shane’s partner Denise O’Brien, 49, who turned a “blind eye” to the abuse was not sentenced to prison time. The pair both pleaded guilty to two counts of child cruelty and were sentenced at Oxford Crown Court on Wednesday. Prosecutor Alexandra Bull described the crimes as “physical abuse, sadistic punishment, emotional abuse and neglect”. The siblings remembered numerous episodes of cruelty at the hands of their father, they told the court.

The daughter also recalled being made to write “I am a liar, I am a stealer” 1000 times on paper, before being “whipped” by Mr O’Brien. The daughter told the court she begged for them to stop while they cut her hair, but she said her pleas were “worthless”. In another incident Mr O’Brien “bashed” his son’s head repeatedly against a wall after he downloaded games on a phone while the couple had been away. The court was also told the boy was told after having his own head shaved “it was a sign he was a liar”. The son was also not given food, and was prevented from using the toilet — instead having to use a bottle in his room. The children were also forbidden from having friends by both parents, who deleted numbers from their phones. The children both engaged in self harm, and Mr O’Brien poured vinegar into their open wounds. The court was told their father told them, “that will be a lesson not to self-harm again”. During a police interview Mr O’Brien told officers his son was “manipulative and a pathological liar”. Both parents later admitted their roles in the abuse. Sentencing Judge Nigel Daly said children had been victims of “gratuitous degradation”. Mr O’Brien was jailed for 26 months on Wednesday.

Qantas has confirmed thousands of ground staff will lose their jobs after a cost-cutting decision to outsource the majority of its ground-handling operations. ,"['travel', 'travel updates', 'health & safety'] []","The embattled airline has revealed 2000 jobs will be permanently axed across 10 Australian airports as part of its operational overhaul to ensure the flying kangaroo can remain in the skies beyond the coronavirus pandemic. Qantas’s decision comes after months of operational reviews that began in August to reduce the size of the business following subdued travel numbers due to the health crisis. Monday’s announcement brings the total job losses at Qantas to about 8500 of its 29,000 pre-pandemic workforce. The Transport Workers’ Union (TWU) has lashed out at Australia’s premier airline, saying it was a “dark day” for the industry and will force more families to face the grim prospect of joining the Centrelink queue. In a press conference on Monday afternoon, TWU national secretary Michael Kaine said the decision was a not a “COVID response” and contradicted Qantas’s obligations under the federal government’s JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme. TWU national secretary Michael Kaine said Qantas’s decision was a not a ‘COVID response. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Gaye GerardSource:News Corp Australia “(The federal government) continues to pump millions of dollars into Qantas through wage supports and other financial assistance with no conditions attached,” Mr Kaine said. “There is no benefit to the Australian community when taxpayers spend billions only to result in workers in good jobs being thrown on the scrap heap.” The aviation industry has been financially obliterated by COVID-19, with the health crisis causing Qantas to report a $2.7 billion statutory loss for the 2020 financial year. The airports impacted include international and domestic operations at Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Ground services at Perth, Adelaide, Canberra, Cairns, Darwin, Townsville and Alice Springs have also been cut. Axed Qantas worker Leonie Piggott said the airline’s move was “un-Australian” and would result in thousands of workers being subjected to worse working conditions and less pay. “We are devastated … it’s going to be heartbreaking,” she said. “Everyone is just so upset and outraged the way that it has been done. It’s just un-Australian and abhorrent.” Ms Piggott also said the federal government should be stepping in to reverse the airline’s decision.

Airlines around the world are having to make dramatic decisions in order to survive, and the damage will take years to repair.” The premier airline said impacted staff would be entitled to redundancy packages, and it would help workers find jobs outside of the company. It is expected the outsourcing of ground-handling operations will reduce costs by $100 million annually and avoid large spending on ground-handling equipment. It is understood most major airlines around the world outsourced ground handling services to third parties years ago. Qantas chief executive of domestic and international operations Andrew David said the industry had been turned ‘upside down’. Picture: Bianca De Marchi/AAPSource:AAP “Qantas has spent hundreds of millions in training these workers up over decades to achieve high standards, and the idea of pushing them out the door to replace them with less-trained workers on lower conditions is sickening,” Mr Kaine from the TWU said. The TWU has also taken aim at the millions of dollars paid to senior executives during the pandemic. In the financial year 2019, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce received a $24 million pay package – making him the highest paid CEO in Australia and the highest paid airline boss in the world. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Qantas has taken on an additional $1.5 billion in debt in order to keep the business afloat. Mr Joyce and other senior executives took significant pay reductions after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in March. In financial year 2019, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce received a $24 million pay package.

Mr David said the in-house bid by the TWU was completely theoretical and did not articulate how projected cost savings would be achieved. He said Qantas had made three separate extensions for the TWU, but the union failed to “outline sufficient practical detail”. “Even with the involvement of a large accounting firm, the bid falls well short of what the specialist external providers were able to come up with,” he said. The TWU said outsourcing specialist ground handlers was unsafe and the bid process was a sham. It also claimed outsourcing would lower wages and working conditions, and Qantas was rorting the federal government’s JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme. Qantas refutes these claims.

After the US reported its first coronavirus case on January 21 it took 99 days for the country to have a million confirmed cases, CNN reports. From there it took 43 days for the US to reach two million, and then by July 8, there were three million Americans diagnosed with COVID-19. As of today Johns Hopkins University is reporting that the United States is sitting on more than four million confirmed coronavirus cases. HOPES FOR A VACCINE According to US President Donald Trump the country has conducted more than 50 million coronavirus tests. Mr Trump on Tuesday warned that the pandemic was likely to get worse before it gets better but repeated his claim that the pandemic would somehow “disappear”. The US president has been a critic of lockdown measures and has argued in favour of reopening the economy even as death tolls have climbed.

More than 200 candidate drugs are being developed, with 23 having progressed to clinical trials. The United States has agreed to pay almost $2.8 billion for 100 million doses of a potential vaccine being developed by German firm BioNTech and US giant Pfizer. Another leading candidate, developed in part by pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, registered promising results from clinical trials this week. But the firm’s chief said on Tuesday a global rollout was not imminent. “We hope to be able to produce a vaccine by the end of the year … perhaps a little earlier if all goes well,” said Pascal Soriot. – with AFP ",news.com.au,,"July 24, 2020"

Two men can be seen putting their hands in the air as they’re surrounded by officers. The incident occurred during two ideologically opposed protests, both held at Denver’s Civic Center Park, nearby the Denver Art Museum. One protest called “BLM-Antifa Soup Drive” had been hosted by the Denver Communists, while a “Patriot Muster” rally was organised for the same location, asking followers to “stand up” and “show up”. Videos showed heated arguments between protesters before the incident. It’s unclear if the suspects or the victim had been affiliated with any of the groups, Chief Montoya said, according to US ABC News. “There was a large presence because we had two groups with opposing views, and we know that can always get very tense, and there’s always potential for violence,” he said. Denver Police subsequently said in a statement that “further investigation has determined the suspect is a private security guard with no affiliation to Antifa”.

A journalist from the Denver Post, who claimed to have witnessed the incident, said a man affiliated with a “Patriot Rally” sprayed mace in the face of one of the left-wing protesters, who then shot him. The Denver Post updated its story after “authorities called into the question the accuracy of that journalist’s report concerning the affiliation of the shooter”, the editor’s note said. 9News Denver identified the two arrested as one of its producers and a private security guard hired by the station.

42,Coronavirus: New Zealand has 36 active cases of COVID-19,"New Zealand has recorded 13 new COVID cases in Auckland, with the country’s total number of active cases now at 36.   New Zealand has recorded 13 new COVID cases in Auckland, all of whom will go into quarantine.","['world', 'coronavirus', 'global'] ['Jacinda Ardern', 'coronavirus']","All of the new cases are linked to the original four confirmed cases from the new outbreak in the city’s south, which was first reported on Tuesday night. One additional person is in managed isolation - a woman in her 30s who arrived from the Philippines. New Zealand’s health chief Dr Ashley Bloomfield said the total number of active cases is now 36. Two of the new cases are children under the age of nine. It comes after three more staff members at the Americold warehouse centre in Auckland tested positive to COVID-19. The three staffers worked alongside a man who already tested positive. “It‘s not good. There’s a lot of people awaiting test results, they’ve got families. There’s a lot of anxiety and concern,”Americold managing director Richard Winnall told The New Zealand Herald. New Zealand’s top health authority has hit out at claims the country is being too soft on people infected with COVID-19. Director-general of health Ashley Bloomfield dismissed the suggestion the government wasn’t going hard enough on quarantining people who may have come into contact with the virus. “I don’t think we have been soft on this at all. We don’t round up people in New Zealand,” he told Newstalk ZB. “We round up sheep; we don’t round up people.” It comes after it was revealed a high school student in Auckland has now tested positive for coronavirus – a person who was a close contact of the original family of whom four members tested positive. Dr Bloomfield said some of the original family were in a quarantine facility but not all of them. New Zealand’s Cabinet will decide on the future of the country’s lockdown tomorrow, including how long the new restrictions last, the severity of the new outbreak and whether the source of infection has been found. “We are getting all our information together so we can get the best possible advice. I feel confident we will have a lot more good information to inform a good decision,” Dr Bloomfield said. RELATED: How did COVID-19 resurface in New Zealand?  New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern and health director-general Ashley Bloomfield immediately put Auckland into stage 3 restrictions after the new cases came to light. Picture: New Zealand HeraldSource:Supplied New Zealand’s deputy leader Winston Peters said authorities “won’t know for sure” how the virus reappeared in the country until the medical evidence comes in. “We don’t know how far it’s spread in the last 24 hours. We don’t know how wide the spread is, whether it’s dispersed outside of Auckland and whether we have a fix on all the cases. It is one of those in-between times. We need to know the research and the evidence and we don’t have it yet,” he told Today. He said New Zealanders “from the Prime Minister down” are “all annoyed about this”. “We have to grit our teeth. It is not about the politicians or anyone else. It is about five million New Zealanders. We have to get our team together and that has to be our number one focus.” ‘LOW POSSIBILITY’ VIRUS CAME IN ON FREIGHT Virus hunters in New Zealand are racing to determine whether the mystery outbreak after 100 days COVID-free could have been freighted into the country in frozen food, or even remain frozen in a cold storage facility for weeks. One of the family members works in a coolstore that takes imported frozen goods from overseas. But Dr Bloomfield said it was only a “low possibility” the virus came in on freight. “We are working flat out to do the contact tracing we need to do and trace back to find out what the source of this infection is,” he said. Epidemiologist at Melbourne University, Tony Blakely, said it was “bizarre” how the virus had risen again, but he also did not believe it could have come in on freight. RELATED: Ardern slams virus conspiracy theory Authorities said it was only a ‘low possibility’ the virus came in on freight.

That causes anxiety for many of us,” Dr Bloomfield said. “We are working hard to put together the pieces of the puzzle as to how this family got the virus. We are testing all close and casual contacts.” FROM ‘SUCCESSFUL ELIMINATION’ TO LOCKDOWN With a population of five million, New Zealand won widespread praise for its effective handling of the coronavirus pandemic after closing its borders on March 19.

Since then, Mr Trump and his wife Melania Trump have tested positive for coronavirus after the president’s close aide Hope Hicks became infected.

Picture: Alex Wong/Getty Images/AFPSource:AFP RELATED: Donald Trump tests positive for the coronavirus, so does Melania The President’s positive test has also sparked concerns the Democratic candidate Mr Biden could have been exposed to coronavirus during Tuesday’s debate. Mr Trump, 74, and Mr Biden, 77, are both in a high risk category for having more severe symptoms from the virus, because of their age. During the debate, moderator Chris Wallace asked Mr Trump about his position on masks. “President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer,” Wallace said. “And in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the efficacy of masks?” “No, I think masks are okay,” Mr Trump replied. “You have to understand, if you look … I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. “Tonight, as an example, everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks …” “Just like your rally,” Mr Biden said. “ … when needed. When needed, I wear masks,” Mr Trump said. Mr Trump then continued: “I don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen.” Mr Biden responded, and started talking about reopening businesses. “Well, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters. It matters.” Mr Trump responded, insisting he’d also been told “the opposite”. “And they’ve also said the opposite. They’ve also said …” “No serious person has said the opposite. No serious person,” Mr Biden said. Wallace, the moderator then tried to interject but Mr Trump continued, saying: “Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said the opposite. “He did not say the opposite,” Mr Biden said. Dr Anthony Fauci is the head of the Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been urging all US citizens in a community setting to wear face masks to slow the spread of COVID-19 since July. The CDC’s director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, said face coverings are “one of the most powerful weapons” in stopping the spread of coronavirus. Mr Trump insisted there had been ‘no problem whatsoever’ after holding large rallies with no masks. Picture: (Photos by Jim Watson and Saul Loeb/ AFPSource:AFP “I want to ask you, we’ve got a little more than a minute left in this segment …” Wallace said, again trying to move away from a discussion about masks. “He said very strongly, ‘Masks are not good’. Then he changed his mind. He said, ‘Masks are good’.” Mr Trump continued. “I’m okay with masks. I’m not fighting masks.” Wallace then brought up the two candidates different approaches to campaigning. “President Trump, you’re holding large rallies with crowds packed together, thousands of people,” Wallace said. “Outside,” Mr Trump said. “Outside. Yes, sir. Agreed,” Wallace said. “Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with …” “Because nobody will show up,” Mr Trump said. “Well, it’s true. Nobody shows up to his rallies.” Mr Trump defended holding larger rallies, saying “people want to hear what I have to say”. “I’m doing my job as a president, and I’ll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people.” When asked if he was worried about the disease, Mr Trump said, “Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It’s outside. “That’s a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. “And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace.” Mr Biden fired back at this point, saying Mr Trump had been concerned about being infected by his fans. “By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had,” Mr Biden said. “A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, ‘No, no, no. Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I’m way far away from those other people’. “That’s what he said, ‘I’m going to be okay’. He’s not worried about you. He’s not worried about the people out there.” Mr Trump insisted there’d been no “negative effect” at various rallies, which he said had been attended by up to 35,000 and 40,000 people. “He’s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to,” Mr Biden said. “He’s a fool on this.” “If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing,” Mr Trump said as a final shot. “But you can’t.

44,Coronavirus: How did COVID-19 resurface in New Zealand?,"New Zealand went more than 100 days without a single case. Now, the country is back on lockdown. Where did the COVID-19 cases come from? With New Zealand back in lockdown, officials are now investigating the possibility that the new coronavirus cases came through imported freight.","['world', 'coronavirus', 'global'] ['Jacinda Ardern', 'coronavirus']","The cases have no known source, and health experts are now scrambling to figure out how, in a country that closed its borders months ago and was so successful at containment, four people managed to contract the virus. New Zealand has long received global praise for its swift response to the coronavirus pandemic, and until Tuesday had not recorded a single case in more than 100 days. Authorities said the new cases had no connection to overseas travel. The first case confirmed was a man in his 50s who presented to their GP with symptoms on Monday. The man had strong symptoms including a fever and a cough, and the man’s partner also had strong symptoms, both later tested positive, alongside two other family members. On Wednesday, another confirmed case was linked to the outbreak and four other close contacts are isolating after showing symptoms. RELATED: Auckland returns to Stage 3 restrictions VIRUS MAY HAVE TRAVELLED ON IMPORTED FREIGHT Officials are now investigating the possibility that the virus travelled into New Zealand on refrigerated freight. The country’s health director-general Dr Ashley Bloomfield said surface testing was under way in an Auckland cool storage facility where a man from the infected family worked. “We do know from studies overseas, that actually, the virus can survive in some refrigerated environments for quite some time,” he said. China has reported instances of coronavirus being detected on the packaging of imported frozen seafood. Dr Bloomfield was unsure if the cool store was receiving international freight that had been refrigerated for its whole journey. The cool storage facility where the man worked, in Mount Wellington, had been closed down along with three other sites the company had around the city, he said. The 160 staff across all the facilities would be tested for COVID-19. Professor Michael Plank, an expert at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, said “surface contamination” was a possibility for how the virus may have re-emerged in New Zealand. “The most likely scenario is still that the outbreak started at the border, either with an international arrival or someone working at government-managed isolation,” he told news.com.au. “The fact that there is no known link between the new cases and a border worker suggests that there are several links in the chain that we don’t yet know about. “For example, it could have been passed on by an asymptomatic carrier, someone who didn’t get tested, or possibly via an environmental route like surface contamination.” RELATED: World reacts to New Zealand virus cases Testing sites have reopened in Auckland. Picture: Fiona Goodall/Getty ImagesSource:Getty Images New Zealand authorities said environmental factors will be examined closely during investigations. At a press conference earlier today, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Dr Bloomfield said the positive case’s workplace has been closed at all sites. “They are all shut down and there is both testing of all those who work there and also of the environment in that workplace. We want to see if possibly the environment is implicated here,” Dr Bloomfield said. Prof Plank said authorities will need to undertake a lot of testing to work out how far the virus has spread. “It’s more effective at this stage to target this to high-risk groups than just do random testing. This means people with symptoms and people identified by contact tracing teams.” He also warned that the lack of a known link means there could be several more cases in New Zealand that are yet to be discovered. “The fact that these new cases have no known link to international travel or people working at the border makes the situation more serious.” RELATED: NZ expats blast Ardern Testing sites have reopened in Auckland. Picture: Fiona Goodall/Getty ImagesSource:Getty Images Associate Professor Garry Nixon from the University of Otago suggested there was always a threat of new cases, even after 100 days without community transmission. “This is disappointing but not entirely unexpected,” he said. “Different alert levels between different parts of the country is a sensible approach in the circumstances. But this is something we have not previously seen. “Minimising movement between regions is now more important. People shifting out of the cities to sit out the last lockdown at the beach was a problem last time. Now it risks not only putting undue pressure on stretched rural health services, it also risks introducing the virus into communities at lower alert levels, where it can spread more easily.” FROM ‘SUCCESSFUL ELIMINATION’ TO LOCKDOWN  With a population of five million, New Zealand won widespread praise for its effective handling of the coronavirus pandemic after closing its borders on March 19.

While it’s expected that Aucklanders will most likely stay in lockdown for longer than three days, a worst-case scenario would mean it could be seven weeks, a top scientist warned. Epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker told The New Zealand Herald it all came down to determining how far this outbreak had already spread and if a direct link to an overseas case could be identified. “You would expect a longer lockdown would be more likely. The most positive outcome is if contact tracing identifies a clear line of transmission from an imported case or someone working at managed quarantine,” Prof Baker said. “If the direct line to imported cases is established quickly, that’s very helpful and then it’s finding out the extent of infection among the contacts. If some of them are infected then it’s working out the extent of infection among their contacts and so it goes on.” Prof Baker said the extreme scenario would be that New Zealand would go back to the situation in March when the virus was extinguished after five weeks at level 4 and then two weeks at level 3. “I don’t think anyone is imagining that will be necessary this time around, but if you are taking the extreme range of possibilities, we know from experience in March that it was very effective.” Prof Baker said the wider the outbreak and the more time it took to contact trace, the longer people will be in lockdown. – with Emma Russell  ",news.com.au,,"August 13, 2020"

When she began to deteriorate her mother, Justina Ward, called paramedics. She was quickly admitted to a top London children’s hospital after doctors recognised her illness was complex and advanced, according to NBC News. She quickly started to show coronavirus symptoms and was sedated and placed on a ventilator in an intensive care unit where she remained for two weeks. She was put in a “prone” position for 16 hours a day — laying on her front, allowing for maximum ventilation to the back of the lungs. During this time, Nia was monitored by an anaesthesiologist. Nia eventually began to recover and was taken off a ventilator — but several days after this her condition worsened and she began to experience neurological symptoms.

I could hear voices. It was very traumatic.” She also began to experience repeated, violent seizures, according to NBC’s report. The symptoms left her exhausted and sleeping for long periods of time. Following the development of these symptoms, she was readmitted to the ICU. During this time, Nia’s personality and behaviour began to regress, and she started to appear like a younger version of herself. “I don’t know which was scarier, her being on the ventilator not being able to breathe, or the fact that she came out of it with a completely different personality,” said Ms Ward, Nia’s mother. The teenager was diagnosed with encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain by Dr Ming Lim, a paediatric neurologist from the Evelina London Children’s Hospital. Dr Lim, who is experienced with childhood inflammatory disorders, said Nia was never diagnosed with COVID-19. But he had seen patients who had a similar “COVID picture” of symptoms, who had tested positive for coronavirus. He said many early patients were subjected to unreliable testing and his team had no reason not to diagnose her with COVID-19. Dr Lim diagnosed Nia’s neurological symptoms as a late-onset, secondary inflammatory illness linked with COVID-19. He said he and his colleagues are focused on the impact the coronavirus is having on children. “We worry that the long-term effect would be in essentially brain growth,” he said.

Mr Trump also took personal aim at Jonathan Karl, ABC US News’ chief White House correspondent, after he asked the president why he “lied to the American people and why should we trust what you have to say now?” “That’s a terrible question and the phraseology. I didn’t lie,” Trump responded. “Your question, the way you phrased that is such a disgrace. It’s a disgrace to ABC television network. It’s a disgrace to your employer.” According to excerpts of Woodward’s new book, Rage, that were published Wednesday by the Washington Post, Mr Trump told the journalist during a recorded telephone interview that the situation regarding the virus was much more dire than he was admitting publicly. “You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed,” Mr Trump told Woodward during a Feb. 7 call. “And so that’s a very tricky one. That’s a very delicate one. It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flu.” “This is deadly stuff,” the president said. Though this conversation happened in February, it was not reported until now. At that time, Mr Trump was saying that the contagion was no more virulent than the seasonal flu, that the government had the virus under control and that it would soon disappear. “I wanted to always play it down,” the president told Woodward in a March conversation. As of Thursday, COVID-19 has infected more than 6.3 million Americans and killed more than 191,000, according to numbers compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The coronavirus – and the Trump administration’s handling of the outbreak – has become arguably the most important issue as Americans prepare to vote in November’s general election. RELATED: ‘It is sick’: Rival unloads on Trump Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has attacked the President over the comments. Picture: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images/AFPSource:AFP Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, and his supporters have blamed Mr Trump for the massive spread of the contagion in the country and for the economic toll it had wreaked. Mr Trump has hit back at Mr Biden for opposing the ban on travel from China in late January and for the former vice president’s own handling of the swine flu pandemic in 2009. “Joe’s decision to publicly attack the China ban so he lacks the character, intelligence or instinct to do what is right,” Mr Trump said as he accused Mr Biden of using the virus for “political gain.” Mr Trump added: “The swine flu was a disaster. His failed approach to the swine flu was disastrous.” The swine flu, or H1N1, outbreak in 2009 did infect many more people in the US than the coronavirus so far has – 60.8 million compared to 6.3 million – but it only killed 12,469 people in the country compared to the coronavirus, which has claimed more than 191,000 lives in the U.S. Besides answering questions about his handling of the pandemic, the president also announced that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was travelling to Qatar to discuss participate in intra-Afghan peace negotiations. The long-awaited peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government’s negotiating team are to begin on Saturday. The talks were laid out in a peace deal that Washington brokered with the Taliban and signed in February, also in Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office. At the time, the deal was seen as Afghanistan’s best chance at ending more than four decades of relentless war. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Qantas has confirmed thousands of ground staff will lose their jobs after a cost-cutting decision to outsource the majority of its ground-handling operations. ,"['travel', 'travel updates', 'health & safety'] []","The embattled airline has revealed 2000 jobs will be permanently axed across 10 Australian airports as part of its operational overhaul to ensure the flying kangaroo can remain in the skies beyond the coronavirus pandemic. Qantas’s decision comes after months of operational reviews that began in August to reduce the size of the business following subdued travel numbers due to the health crisis. Monday’s announcement brings the total job losses at Qantas to about 8500 of its 29,000 pre-pandemic workforce. The Transport Workers’ Union (TWU) has lashed out at Australia’s premier airline, saying it was a “dark day” for the industry and will force more families to face the grim prospect of joining the Centrelink queue. In a press conference on Monday afternoon, TWU national secretary Michael Kaine said the decision was a not a “COVID response” and contradicted Qantas’s obligations under the federal government’s JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme. TWU national secretary Michael Kaine said Qantas’s decision was a not a ‘COVID response. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Gaye GerardSource:News Corp Australia “(The federal government) continues to pump millions of dollars into Qantas through wage supports and other financial assistance with no conditions attached,” Mr Kaine said. “There is no benefit to the Australian community when taxpayers spend billions only to result in workers in good jobs being thrown on the scrap heap.” The aviation industry has been financially obliterated by COVID-19, with the health crisis causing Qantas to report a $2.7 billion statutory loss for the 2020 financial year. The airports impacted include international and domestic operations at Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Ground services at Perth, Adelaide, Canberra, Cairns, Darwin, Townsville and Alice Springs have also been cut. Axed Qantas worker Leonie Piggott said the airline’s move was “un-Australian” and would result in thousands of workers being subjected to worse working conditions and less pay. “We are devastated … it’s going to be heartbreaking,” she said. “Everyone is just so upset and outraged the way that it has been done. It’s just un-Australian and abhorrent.” Ms Piggott also said the federal government should be stepping in to reverse the airline’s decision.

Airlines around the world are having to make dramatic decisions in order to survive, and the damage will take years to repair.” The premier airline said impacted staff would be entitled to redundancy packages, and it would help workers find jobs outside of the company. It is expected the outsourcing of ground-handling operations will reduce costs by $100 million annually and avoid large spending on ground-handling equipment. It is understood most major airlines around the world outsourced ground handling services to third parties years ago. Qantas chief executive of domestic and international operations Andrew David said the industry had been turned ‘upside down’. Picture: Bianca De Marchi/AAPSource:AAP “Qantas has spent hundreds of millions in training these workers up over decades to achieve high standards, and the idea of pushing them out the door to replace them with less-trained workers on lower conditions is sickening,” Mr Kaine from the TWU said. The TWU has also taken aim at the millions of dollars paid to senior executives during the pandemic. In the financial year 2019, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce received a $24 million pay package – making him the highest paid CEO in Australia and the highest paid airline boss in the world. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Qantas has taken on an additional $1.5 billion in debt in order to keep the business afloat. Mr Joyce and other senior executives took significant pay reductions after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in March.

Mr David said the in-house bid by the TWU was completely theoretical and did not articulate how projected cost savings would be achieved. He said Qantas had made three separate extensions for the TWU, but the union failed to “outline sufficient practical detail”. “Even with the involvement of a large accounting firm, the bid falls well short of what the specialist external providers were able to come up with,” he said. The TWU said outsourcing specialist ground handlers was unsafe and the bid process was a sham. It also claimed outsourcing would lower wages and working conditions, and Qantas was rorting the federal government’s JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme. Qantas refutes these claims.

50,Portland shooting: Donald Trump supporter shot dead in clash with BLM protesters,"With “lawlessness” rampant on America’s streets, President Donald Trump has decided who is to blame – and he isn’t holding back. US President Donald Trump and his election opponent, Joe Biden, are trading insults and accusations amid escalating violence in the country’s cities.","['world', 'north america', 'us politics'] ['Donald Trump', 'Joe Biden']","But Mr Biden is not the only target of Mr Trump’s ire. Yesterday, a man believed to be a supporter of the President was shot dead during confrontations between a caravan of pro-Trump demonstrators and Black Lives Matter protesters in Portland, Oregon. The caravan included about 600 vehicles. Mr Trump has praised the participants, calling them “great patriots”. GREAT PATRIOTS! https://t.co/BWGxVoBTmI Footage from Portland showed the two groups clashing on the streets, with the Black Lives Matter supporters throwing water bottles and other projectiles at the caravan, which responded by firing paintballs and pepper spray. Police responded to reports of gunfire at 8:46pm on Saturday, local time, and found a man with a gunshot wound to his chest. A homicide investigation is now under way. The victim was wearing a hat with the insignia for Patriot Prayer, a far-right group which frequently protests in support of Mr Trump. “It is still early in this investigation, and I ask everyone to give the detectives time to do their important work before drawing conclusions about what took place,” Police Chief Chuck Lovell said. “This violence is completely unacceptable and we are working diligently to find and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible.” He appealed to the public for information about the shooting. There have been protests against police brutality in the streets of Portland ever since the death of George Floyd in May, but they intensified a week ago after Wisconsin police repeatedly shot an African-American man, Jacob Blake, in the back. The protests have sometimes descended into rioting, vandalism and violence.

Picture: Nathan HowardSource:AFP A protester walking past a dumpster fire. Picture: Nathan HowardSource:AFP TRUMP HAMMERS ‘LAW AND ORDER’ MESSAGE President Trump made “law and order” one of the dominant themes of the Republican National Convention last week. He argues the rioting is a result of weak leadership from Democratic Party politicians, including local mayors, state governors, and Mr Biden. “No one will be safe in Biden’s America,” the President warned during his speech at the White House on Friday AEST. “Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund police departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon.” Since that speech, Mr Trump has continued to take potshots on Twitter, focusing much of his anger on Portland’s Democratic Mayor, Ted Wheeler. “The big backlash going on in Portland cannot be unexpected after 95 days of watching an incompetent Mayor admit that he has no idea what he is doing,” he said overnight. “The people of Portland won’t put up with no safety any longer. The Mayor is a FOOL. Bring in the National Guard!” LAW & ORDER!!! Last week, Mr Wheeler rejected Mr Trump’s offer to send in federal law enforcement. He responded to the President’s criticism during a media conference today. “The President of the United States is somebody who has been perpetrating divisive and hateful language for four years. For him to now stand here and say that it’s unexpected and act as though he is shocked is appalling to me,” Mr Wheeler said. “The tweets that he has been putting out in the last 48 hours attacking Democratic mayors, attacking those who are trying to bring resolution to the violence in their local communities – he has an opportunity to uplift us and bring us together and help us move through this difficult situation in our nation’s history. “Instead, he chooses to play petty politics and divide us. “I’m going to do the work I need to do here in my local community, with my local officials, to take accountability for what’s happening in our streets. And I’d appreciate that either the President support us, or stay the hell out of the way.” Mr Wheeler conceded it was “no secret” that he does not like Mr Trump, but he would “defend to the death the right of a Trump supporter to stand outside my apartment and nonviolently demonstrate”. “When people say they want to come intot he city in a caravan supporting their presidential candidate, we cannot tell them no. They have constitutional rights to be here, rights which I embrace and support. The violence, however, is the problem.” Ted Wheeler, the wacky Radical Left Do Nothing Democrat Mayor of Portland, who has watched great death and destruction of his City during his tenure, thinks this lawless situation should go on forever. Wrong! Portland will never recover with a fool for a Mayor.... ..The people of Portland, like all other cities &  parts of our great Country, want Law & Order. The Radical Left Democrat Mayors, like the dummy running Portland, or the guy right now in his basement unwilling to lead or even speak out against crime, will never be able to do it! The “guy in his basement” Mr Trump referred to there is Mr Biden. The President is planning to visit the other major site of unrest at the moment – Kenosha, Wisconsin, where Mr Blake was shot – on Tuesday, US time. He intends to meet with law enforcement. It is unclear where he will speak with Mr Blake’s family. The protests in Kenosha have also resulted in violence and death. Last week, 17-year-old white teenager Kyle Rittenhouse shot three demonstrators with a semiautomatic rifle, and killed two of them. He has been charged with first-degree homicide. Mr Rittenhouse’s lawyers say he only acted in self-defence. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, today urged Mr Trump to “reconsider” his planned visit to the state. “I, along with other community leaders who have reached out, am concerned about what your presence will mean for Kenosha and our state,” Mr Evers said in a letter to the White House. “I am concerned your presence will only hinder our healing. I am concerned your presence will only delay our work to overcome division and move forward together.” President Trump at a rally in New Hampshire on Friday, US time.

The Democratic presidential nominee will give a speech in Pennsylvania tomorrow addressing the violence. And in an unusually aggressive statement issued today, he slammed Mr Trump. “The deadly violence we saw overnight in Portland is unacceptable. Shooting in the streets of a great American city is unacceptable,” Mr Biden said. “I condemn this violence unequivocally. I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same. “It does not matter if you find the political views of your opponents abhorrent, any loss of life is a tragedy. Today there is another family grieving in America, and Jill and I offer our deepest condolences. “We must not become a country at war with ourselves. A country that accepts the killing of fellow Americans who do not agree with you. A country that vows vengeance towards one another. “But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be, the America he believes we are.” He accused the President of “fanning the flames” and “recklessly encouraging” violence. “We must condemn the incitement of hate and resentment that led to this deadly clash. It is not a peaceful protest when you go out spoiling for a fight,” he said. “What does President Trump think will happen when he continues to insist on fanning the flames of hate and division in our society, and using the politics of fear to whip up his supporters? He is recklessly encouraging violence. “He may believe tweeting about law and order makes him strong, but his failure to call on his supporters to stop seeking conflict shows just how weak he is. He may think that war in our streets is good for his re-election chances, but that is not presidential leadership, or even basic human compassion. “The job of a president is to lower the temperature. To bring people who disagree with one another together. To make life better for all Americans, not just those who agree with us, support us, or vote for us. “Donald Trump has been President for almost four years. The temperature in the country is higher, tensions run stronger, divisions run deeper. And all of us are less safe because Donald Trump can’t do the job.” Once again, a Black man — Jacob Blake — was shot by the police. In front of his children. It makes me sick.Is this the country we want to be?Needless violence won’t heal us. We need to end the violence — and peacefully come together to demand justice. pic.twitter.com/WdNqrxA3PK Mr Biden was also interviewed about the subject by MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell last week, the day after Vice President Mike Pence’s speech to the Republican convention. That speech, like Mr Trump’s the next day, focused heavily on law and order. “(Pence) said that Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to violence in America’s cities, adding that, ‘The hard truth is, you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.’ Your response to that?” Mitchell asked. “You know, he said – yes, Joe Biden’s America. While running a video of Donald Trump’s America,” said Mr Biden. No video was playing while Mr Pence spoke. The convention did include footage of violence, particularly in one video compilation warning viewers about “Biden’s America”. “This is a taste of Biden’s America. The rioting, the crime,” a voiceover said. The footage in that clip actually came from a protest in Barcelona, Spain last year. “The problem we have right now is we’re in Donald Trump’s America,” Mr Biden continued. “He views this as a political benefit to him. You know, he’s rooting for more violence, not less. And let’s be clear about that. “And what’s he doing? He’s pouring gasoline on the fire. This happens to be Donald Trump’s America.

Over the past week, there has been an average of 385 new cases reported each day. Mr Trump said Australia had been “doing incredibly well” and its “leadership was praised”. “This pandemic is devastating the rest of the world,” he said, quoting a Wall Street Journal article about the world’s COVID resurgence. “Countries hailed as models to see – and then they go, ‘The virus returns’ at a level they haven’t even seen. We’ve been giving praise to certain countries and the virus has now come to them like the first time. “There were many countries where everyone was holding them up and saying ‘Look what a great job they did’ – it didn’t work out so well.” The  Wall Street Journal editorial he quoted also specifically named Australia as one of several countries that was experiencing a “second wave”. “Australia’s new daily cases have increased 11-fold in the last month,” the article said. “Cases have increased though Australia’s government locked down Melbourne. Civil disobedience is rife. Nearly 90 per cent of the infected didn’t isolate between the time they started showing symptoms and were tested, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews recently noted. “More than half of those infected didn’t isolate after being tested and when they got their results.” But many on social media have criticised the comparison, saying comparing Australia and the US is “like comparing a BB gun and an atom bomb”.

The Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic has faced heavy criticism for poor messaging and opening up too soon. Some experts have disputed the claim that certain countries are going through a “second wave”, saying the spread is instead likely to be “one big wave”. WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris warned that people need to remain vigilant despite lockdowns easing. She said the idea of a “second wave” is flawed because the spread of the virus does not seem to be seasonal, stressing that the dangers remain all year. “People are still thinking about seasons,” she told a press conference on Tuesday. “What we all need to get our heads around is this is a new virus and it is behaving, even though it is a respiratory virus, even though respiratory viruses in the past did tend to this different seasonal waves, this one is behaving differently. “There seems to be this persistent belief that summer is not a problem. “Summer is a problem. This virus likes all weathers, but what it particularly likes is jumping from one person to another when we come in close contact. “So let‘s not give it that opportunity. The second wave idea, we are in the first wave. It’s going to be one big wave.” She said social distancing remains the best way to prevent transmission of the virus. “It‘s going to go up and down a bit,” she continued, “Now, the best thing is to flatten it and turn it into just something lapping at your feet. “The season does not seem to be affecting the transmission of this virus currently. “What is affecting the transmission of this virus is mass gatherings, it is people coming together and people not social distancing, not talking the precautions to ensure they are not in close contact.” ",news.com.au,,"July 31, 2020"

Prime Minister Scott Morrison claimed his appointment as a win for the country, saying it is “the most senior appointment of an Australian candidate to an international body for decades”. “This is a great honour for Mathias who has worked tirelessly over several months to engage with leaders, senior ministers and officials of OECD member nations from Europe, Asia and the Americas,” he said. “The appointment is recognition of Australia’s global agency and standing among fellow liberal democracies and our practical commitment and contribution to multilateral co-operation.” The OECD has been one of the world’s most important international economic institutions for 60 years. “As the global economy recovers from COVID19, the OECD’s role in shaping international economic, tax and climate change policy will be more critical than ever,” Mr Morrison said.

54,Push to strip China of right to host Beijing Winter Olympics,A global campaign is underway to strip China of the right to host the Beijing Winter Olympic Games in 2022 over allegations of human rights abuses. A global group of political leaders is pushing the International Olympics Committee (IOC) to reconsider Beijing as the host of the 2022 Olympic Winter Games.,"['sport', 'olympics'] ['China']","The coalition of MPs have voiced their increasing concerns over China’s poor human right’s record according to a report from the Sydney Morning Herald. The push signals a new potential alliance between conservative MPs and human rights advocacy groups who could work to threaten a boycott of the games. It could also potentially affect the game’s finances as the Tokyo Summer Olympics struggles to stay on schedule for 2021, after being postponed by the coronavirus pandemic. “I have asked that the IOC thinks again about hosting in China,” said Sir Iain Duncan Smith, a British MP, and co-chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China and former leader of the Conservative Party in Britain. Sir Iain said other countries needed to be “more supportive of Australia”, who’d been turned into “a scapegoat” after calling for an international inquiry into the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. “The free world does have a strong position to say the bullying, the threatening, the internal repression, the border disputes, the arrogant attitude to your neighbours, the breaking of the treaty with Hong Kong – these must have consequences,” Sir Iain said. “At the moment the Chinese believe these consequences are no more than just condemnation.” RELATED: Tokyo Olympics will go ahead ‘with or without COVID’  A group of MPs are urging the IOC to reconsider allowing China to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Picture: Saul Loeb/APSource:AAP The call comes after a group of more than 160 human rights advocacy groups delivered an open letter to the IOC also urging it reconsider. Picture: Odd Andersen/AFPSource:AFP RELATED: ‘Simplified’ Olympics gets $350m cash boost The calls from Sir Iain follow more than 160 human rights advocacy groups delivering a joint letter to the chief of the IOC at the start of September, urging the committee to reconsider Beijing as the location for the games. “The IOC must recognise that the Olympic spirit and the reputation of the Olympic Games will suffer further damage if the worsening human rights crisis, across all areas under China’s control, is simply ignored,” the letter read. The letter also argued that Beijing’s hosting of the Summer games in 2008 emboldened China to engage in different policies including targeting ethnic minorites including Uyghur people. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has rejected accusations from the humans right advocacy groups that the government violated human rights. “The groundless allegations of these organisations are not worth refuting,” foreign affairs spokesman Zhao Lijian said. “Attempts to politicise sports run counter to the spirit of the Olympic Charter. China firmly opposes them.” The alliance pushing for the IOC to reconsider the games is made up of 160 members from the United States, Canada, the UK, Japan, New Zealand and Europe. The alliance also includes a number of Australian politicians including Andrew Hastie, Tim Wilson, Kimberley Kitching, Eric Abetz, Kevin Andrews, James Paterson, Amanda Stoker and Raff Ciccone.

57,Woolworths posts profit rise due to elevated sales during the coronavirus pandemic,"One of the country’s largest supermarket retailers has posted a major bump in profit due to the ongoing shift to essential spending during the pandemic.  Woolworths says increased spending on groceries and at-home entertainment during the coronavirus pandemic has boosted its bottom line, allowing it to increase its interim dividend payout to shareholders. ","['finance', 'business', 'retail'] []","The supermarket and retailing giant posted a net profit after tax for the first half of 2021 financial year of $1.135bn, a 28 per cent jump on the same period last year. Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci said the first half of the current financial year was still impacted by COVID-19 and prompted a continuation of the spending shift towards essential goods and services. “The first half … continued to be impacted by COVID, with elevated sales and higher costs as we worked to maintain a COVIDSafe environment for our customers and team,” Mr Banducci said. “While we have all been living in this uncertain environment now for 12 months, ongoing localised outbreaks remind us that we need to remain both vigilant and agile.” Elevated sales in core businesses such as supermarkets, drinks and BigW were able to offset the higher incurred costs of the pandemic and the major slump in trading within its hotels division. Woolworths CEO Brad Banducci noted a spending shift towards essential goods and services. Picture: John Feder/The AustralianSource:News Corp Australia Sales at Woolworths Metro stores over the period were lower as a result of less foot traffic in CBD locations, declining 6.7 per cent to $456m. Mr Banducci said the company had made no decision on axing any CBD sites but was monitoring Metro store performance. “It is an ongoing question for us,” he said. “We have unfortunately had to (already) mothball a number of our Metro stores.” Group earnings before tax and interest rose 10.5 per cent over the period to $2.09bn. Total revenue rose 10.6 per cent to $38.85bn, with the company noting stronger supermarket sales and at-home consumption of alcohol and entertainment, as a result of the pandemic, had prompted a rise in turnover. “ (BigW) Sales increased in all destination areas and were buoyed by seasonal sales events such as Halloween, Click Frenzy, Big Sale (Black Friday) and Christmas,” Mr Banducci said. Mr Banducci also noted BigW digital activity over the period had surpassed in-store foot traffic for the first time. Woolworths declared an interim dividend of 53 cents per share, with approximately $671m being returned to shareholders. It is a 15.2 per cent jump on last year’s dividend. Woolworths chair Gordon Cairns said the group was on track for its liquor business Endeavour Drinks to be spun out by June this year. “We had previously indicated that we were targeting calendar 2021 for a potential separation of Endeavour Group.

China said it would apply sanctions against 11 US citizens including officials from Monday in response to Washington‘s move on Friday to impose sanctions on 11 Hong Kong and Chinese officials whom it accused of curtailing political freedoms in the city.","['world', 'asia'] []","Among those targeted were Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley and Pat Toomey and Representative Chris Smith, as well as individuals at non-profits and rights groups. “In response to those wrong US behaviours, China has decided to impose sanctions on individuals who have behaved egregiously on Hong Kong-related issues,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular press briefing on Monday. He did not specify what the sanctions entail. China’s move came after Hong Kong police detained media tycoon Jimmy Lai for allegedly breaching the security law, in what marked the highest-profile arrest since the June legislation came into force. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated over issues ranging from trade to Hong Kong and China‘s handling of COVID-19.

Picture: Isaac Lawrence/AFPSource:AFP Beijing‘s move is the latest in a tit-for-tat round of sanctions between China and the United States over allegations of rights abuses and interference. Washington on Friday imposed sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam as well as the city‘s current and former police chiefs, under an executive order signed by President Donald Trump. Those sanctions freeze any US assets owned by the officials and generally bar Americans from doing business with them. Vice President Mike Pence described the arrest of Mr Lai as “deeply offensive”. “The United States will continue to stand with Jimmy Lai and all the freedom loving people of Hong Kong. #FreeJimmyLai,” Mr Pence wrote on Twitter. “The Chinese Communist party thinks that it can distract from its crackdown on Hong Kong, including the arrest of freedom fighter Jimmy Lai, by re-announcing sanctions against Senator Cruz that were already not credible … It won’t work,” Lauren Blair Aronson, a spokesperson for Senator Ted Cruz, wrote in a statement. Mr Rubio, one of the most vocal China hawks in the Trump administration, made light of Beijing’s move. “Last month #China banned me. Today they sanctioned me. I don’t want to be paranoid but I am starting to think they don’t like me,” Mr Rubio tweeted. Mr Cotton also attacked Beijing, using heavier language. “If China thinks my opposition to its communist tyranny to date warrants these sanctions, I have two words for them: just wait,” he said. The US politicians targeted by Beijing on Monday have been vocal critics of a new national security law that expands Beijing‘s authority in Hong Kong. Last month, China announced sanctions against Mr Cruz, Mr Rubio, Mr Smith and other US officials after Washington penalised senior Chinese officials over the treatment of Uighur Muslims in its Xinjiang region. Beijing‘s latest measure also includes new sanctions against the heads of the US-based campaign groups Freedom House and Human Rights Watch.

Ms Barrett was spotted Friday at her home in South Bend, Indiana, but it’s unclear if she’s aware of Mr Trump’s intentions, CNN said. Ms Barrett is a former law clerk to late right wing Justice Antonin Scalia, and her appointment would tip the Supreme Court to a conservative majority, 6 to 3. The New York Times also reported that Mr Trump had made Ms Barrett his choice. Supreme Court nominees are often informed of their selection at the last possible moment to maintain secrecy. Trump has repeatedly said that he was going to pick a woman and make a formal announcement in the Rose Garden of the White House at 5pm Saturday.

President Trump told reporters on Friday evening he had made up his mind on his Supreme Court nominee, but he refused to confirm that it was Ms Barrett. “I haven’t said that,” Mr Trump said after arriving back in DC from Florida. “I haven’t said it was her, but she is outstanding.” The commander in chief said he did not meet with Lagoa while he was in the Sunshine State. At 48, Ms Barrett would also be the youngest member of the high court and would maintain its conservative majority for decades. The revelation of Mr Trump’s reported intentions came just hours after Ginsburg’s body lay in state at the US Capitol, making her the first woman and the first Jewish person to receive the posthumous honour. Ginsburg, who died September 18 of metastatic pancreatic cancer at 87, will reportedly be buried next week in Arlington National Cemetery, next to her late husband, Marty Ginsburg, who died in 2010. The move to replace Ginsburg ahead of the November 3 election has sparked outrage from Democrats because US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) blocked then-President Barack Obama’s nomination of federal appeals Judge Merrick Garland in 2016 on grounds that it was an election year. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate and two GOP members — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine — have objected to fast-tracking Ginsburg’s replacement, but no others appear ready to break ranks. Earlier this week, Mr Trump called on Republican senators to quickly confirm whoever he nominated so the Supreme Court has a full bench of nine justices to rule on a likely legal battle over mail-in votes cast in his race against former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden. “I think this scam that the Democrats are pulling — it’s a scam,” he said Wednesday. “This scam will be before the United States Supreme Court and I think having the four-four situation is not a good situation if you get that.” In 2017, Mr Trump nominated Ms Barrett, then a Notre Dame law professor, to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, and she was confirmed by the US Senate in a near-party-line vote of 55-43. Ms Barrett was also reportedly on his shortlist to replace Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018 after the jurist announced his retirement at age 81. But Ms Barrett’s White House interview didn’t go well, NPR reported Thursday, citing a source who said she had to wear dark glasses due to a case of conjunctivitis and was “not at her best.” Mr Trump ultimately nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, who was confirmed by a narrow 50-48 margin following a gruelling, four-day hearing during which he emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that he sexually assaulted her while drunk at a party when they were teenagers. A report last year in Axios suggested Mr Trump still had big plans for Barrett, based on private comments he reportedly made to confidants while discussing Kennedy’s replacement. “I’m saving her for Ginsburg,” Mr Trump said in remarks confirmed this week by NPR.

Sweden recorded its highest death toll in 150 years in the first half of 2020, in a count not seen since an infamous famine in 1869.","['world', 'coronavirus', 'global'] ['coronavirus']","The Scandinavian nation, which refused to implement a COVID-19 lockdown, recorded 51,405 deaths between January and June, according to the country’s official statistics office. That figure is around 6500, or 15 per cent, more than the same time period last year. RELATED: Follow our live coronavirus coverage here During the first six months of 1869, a total of 55,431 people died when Sweden was hit by widespread starvation due to poor harvests. The severe famine saw many desperate citizens move to the US. SWEDEN’S CONTROVERSIAL APPROACH TO COVID-19 When most of Europe was in government-enforced lockdown, Sweden did things differently. None of the mandatory lockdowns, police patrolling the streets, or fines for being out of the house were to be found in the Scandinavian country, which instead adopted a controversial “herd immunity” approach to battling the COVID-19 pandemic. The country’s unique strategy to deal with the deadly coronavirus without tanking the economy was to keep schools, cafes, restaurants and shops open, while encouraging people to voluntarily distance themselves and work from home. Stockholm pictured on July 27. (Photo by Jonathan NACKSTRAND / AFP)Source:AFP The idea was that the country would achieve “herd immunity” – a level of the disease where most of the population has been infected, and subsequently developed immunity, which would in turn stop the virus from spreading. The man behind this strategy is Sweden’s chief epidemiologist, Dr Anders Tegnell, the creator and driver of the national COVID-19 strategy. Dr Tegnell was banking on at least 40 per cent of the Swedish population becoming immune to COVID-19. Back in May, he told The Financial Times: “In the autumn there will be a second wave. “Sweden will have a high level of immunity and the number of cases will probably be quite low. But Finland will have a very low level of immunity. Will Finland have to go into a complete lockdown again?” Dr Tegnell was banking on at least 40 per cent of the Swedish population becoming immune to COVID-19. (Photo by Jonathan NACKSTRAND / AFP)Source:AFP But a June study found the number of Swedes who have formed antibodies to the virus is smaller than expected, dashing hopes that herd immunity could be achieved. The study, carried out by the country’s Public Health Agency, found that just 6.1 per cent of the country’s population had developed coronavirus antibodies by late May. This figure falls far short of Dr Tegnell’s prediction. Experts have said achieving herd immunity would require at least 60 per cent of the population to become immune to the virus. The virus has already killed more than 5800 people, giving Sweden one of the world’s highest per capita mortality rates. To compare those figures with other Scandinavian countries, Denmark has recorded 621 deaths, Finland has recorded 334 deaths, and Norway 262. ",news.com.au,,"August 21, 2020"
65,China: Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s brutal government purge,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has issued a new round of purges targeting police and judicial sectors, marking a major shake-up to the government. Chinese President Xi Jinping has issued a new round of purges targeting police and judicial sectors, as part of his ongoing “anti-corruption campaign”. ","['world', 'asia'] ['China']","A senior ally of the President’s called for the purge last month, saying it was time to “turn the blade inwards and scrape the poison off the bone”, the Wall Street Journal reported. Within a week, at least 21 police and juridical officials were being investigated, with dozens more removed from their posts. WHY IS XI DOING THIS? Mr Xi has made sweeping political crackdowns a key feature of his rule, eliminating his main political rivals. Dozens of officials have already been arrested, including at least one major police chief. Mr Xi doesn’t have to fight an election. In 2018 he abolished term limits, effectively allowing him to remain president for life. However, he does need to continue to run campaigns to stay in power, and avoid a potential challenge for his leadership – particularly amid the coronavirus-ravaged economy and rising tensions with the United States. This means purging anyone who could pose a serious threat to that power.

Picture: Nicolas Asfouri/AFPSource:AFP RELATED: China state media labels Australia ‘dog of the US’ While proponents of the purges say they are based on anti-corruption work, China’s leader is targeting political rivals to keep them from taking power away from him. The WSJ revealed at least 21 police and judicial officials are under investigation, including cadres who seem to have performed well. Shanghai police chief Gong Daoan is the most senior target to be pulled. He was accused of “serious violations of party discipline and law” – no accusations, favours being granted or charges of money changing hands. Ever since he became China’s leader in 2012, Mr Xi has overseen a massive anti-corruption drive with more than one million officials either disciplined or removed from their position. It’s a move that harks back to the Mao era, when former Chinese leader Mao Zedong led a Cultural Revolution in 1966 that saw many top officials purged and consolidated his control over the party. During Mr Xi’s first five years in office, 1.34 million officials were brought down over corruption, according to official data. XI ACCUSED OF ‘KILLING A COUNTRY’ A Chinese Communist Party insider has accused Xi Jinping of “killing a country” and making China an “enemy” of the world. Cai Xia, a former professor at China’s elite Central Party School who currently lives in the United States, told The Guardian that his leadership is an “obstacle” to China’s progress. “But those below are too afraid to tell him and wrong decisions continue to be made until the situation is out of control,” she said in June. “In this vicious cycle, there is no way to stop the country from sliding towards disaster.” Ms Cai initially asked the paper not to publish her interview based on threats she and her family received, but backtracked earlier this week, saying: “I have much more freedom now. My speech is free from any constraints. I am responsible only for my own conscience and principles.” RELATED: Why iron ore is Australia’s trump card in China tensions A Chinese Communist Party insider has accused Xi Jinping of making China an ‘enemy’ of the world.

She said Mr Xi’s absolute control had led to several mistakes, including the mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak. In February, it was revealed that Mr Xi had met with the Politburo on January 7 and gave instructions on how to handle the country’s response to the pandemic. But it wasn’t until January 20 that Chinese health officials announced the virus was contagious. Ms Cai said Mr Xi should be held responsible for the outbreak, given he knew about the virus for nearly three weeks. ",news.com.au,,"August 20, 2020"
66,National abortion rights threatened by new US Supreme Court appointment,The rights of women to access abortions across the US are under threat as Republicans clear the way to target 40-year-old laws. Anti-abortion activists are “optimistic” the death of a liberal Supreme court justice will mean the reversal of more than 40 years of laws around abortion in the United States. ,"['world', 'north america', 'us politics'] ['Donald Trump']","Following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last week, Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of anti-abortion organisation the Susan B. Anthony List said she thinks the appointment of a pro-life Justice could be a turning point in reversing the Roe v Wade decision that legalised abortion in 1973. In the US, the landmark Roe v Wade decision ruled the US Constitution protects a woman’s right to have an abortion. But changes in the Supreme Court could lead to the decision being “overturned” or “eroded”, says Ms Dannenfelser. “No matter who you are, you feel the ground shaking underneath,” Ms Dannenfelser told The New York Times podcast The Daily on Wednesday. “I’m feeling very optimistic for the mission that our organisation launched 25 years ago.” And the US appears to be on course to rush through a new conservative Supreme Court justice, days after the death of Justice Ginsberg.

Picture: Mandel Ngan/AFPSource:AFP RELATED: Trump rallies anti-abortion activists Ms Dannenfelser, who formed an alliance with Donald Trump in 2016 before he was elected, said the first commitments they asked for from the President were “pro life Supreme Court justices”. “We wanted to be very clear that means they take a position on abortion that is in alignment with our own,” she said. “There was also a commitment to protect the Hyde Amendment, meaning no taxpayer (can) fund an abortion. “Also defunding and reallocating Planned Parenthood funding to other qualified health centres.” The organisation also asked the President for a bill against abortions after five months of pregnancy. Ms Dannenfelser said during the interview she believes with a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, Roe v Wade will be either “overturned” or “eroded so it’s not as applicable”. “The only laws that will pass will then be the laws that can be sustained by the majority of those states.” She said she believes then “people’s opinions” will be better able to make their way through into different state’s laws. Demonstrators support Planned Parenthood at a protest in St. Louis, Missouri in 2019. Picture: Saul Loeb/AFPSource:AFP After some dissent from senators within the Republican party over whether a new justice should be named before or after the upcoming Presidential election, it appears the path has now been cleared for Mr Trump to push through the appointment of a new conservative justice to replace Ms Ginsburg. The appointment would give conservatives a 6-3 majority on the court. The woman tipped to take the vacant seat is Amy Coney Barrett, 48, an appeals court judge, a devout Catholic, and a mother of seven children. Ms Barrett met with Mr Trump this week, and has already been criticised by Democratic politicians for her views on abortion and same sex-marriage. The judge defended herself, saying she’d “never impose my own personal convictions on the law”. Mr Trump is also due to meet with another potential candidate, Barbara Lagoa, 52, an appeals judge based in Miami. If the President successfully makes the appointment it will be his third supreme court appointment during his presidency and tip the court 6:3 towards the conservatives. During Barack Obama’s second term, Republicans refused to consider the then president’s own nomination nine months out from the election. – With wires ",news.com.au,,"September 24, 2020"

Rattle snakes are squatting in Qantas planes stranded in the Californian desert, prompting crews to come up with new ways to combat the slithering reptiles. ","['travel', 'travel updates'] []","Engineers looking after the airline’s A380 fleet in the Mojave Desert while it is grounded due to Covid-19 are whacking away snakes and scorpions calling plane wheels home. The “wheel whacker” is the latest tool crafted by crews based at the airline’s Los Angeles hanger to help them solve the problem. Rattle snakes are making homes of Qantas A380s parked in the Mojave Desert in California. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied Qantas’ LA engineering manager, Tim Heywood, said weekly maintenance is paramount to ensuring the planes are ready to bring in for service, however storing the A380s in the desert has uncovered a venomous hazard. “The area is well-known for its feisty rattlers who love to curl up around the warm rubber tyres and in the aircrafts’ wheels and brakes,” Mr Heywood said. “We’ve encountered a few rattle snakes and also some scorpions, but the wheel whacker does its job and they scuttle off.” Qantas engineers have developed ’wheel whackers’ to scare off rattlesnakes during A380 maintenance procedures. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied The wheel whacker is a repurposed broom, with each aircraft designated its own hitter complete with the plane’s registration number. A bulk of the world’s planes has been placed in the Mojave Desert for deep storage while travel numbers remain minimal during the pandemic. The A380 fleet is not expected to be brought back into service at least for another two years. Deserts are the prime storage place for planes due to the dry heat and little to no humidity, however the famous US desert is littered with highly venomous rattle snakes. Airlines are well equipped to deal with birds and insects nesting in crevices within planes, but the widescale 2020 grounding has created a new wave of critters looking to find a warm place to live. A number of Qantas A380 planes have been placed in the desert for deep storage due to the pandemic. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied Qantas engineering crews check on aircraft at least once a week at Victorville, a two-hour drive from the air base at LAX. Mr Heywood said this unique part of the weekly inspection is further evidence of how strange the past year has been for the aviation industry, especially for the A380 fleet which normally would rarely spend more than 24 hours on the ground. Mr Heywood noted the whackers are to ensure no harm comes to either the engineers or the snakes. “The first thing we do before we unwrap and start any ground inspection of the landing gear in particular is to walk around the aircraft stomping our feet and tapping the wheels with a wheel whacker to wake up and scare off the snakes,” he said. Snakes and scorpions are making plane wheels their home because of the warmth. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied “Only then do we carefully approach each wheel and unwrap them before performing our pressure checks and visual inspections.” Qantas in the last week woke up one of its A380s for a quick fly down to LA for a maintenance check, called a gear swing procedure. It is the first time in 290 days a Qantas A380 has been in the sky. Before the pandemic a number of the airline’s A380s were refurbished but have not yet been used in service. “Aircraft like these are highly technical and you can’t just land it at the storage facility, park it and walk away,” Mr Heywood said. “Some of these aircraft have brand-new interiors still with the plastic on the seats, so we are proud to keep them in top-notch condition until the time comes for them to fly again. “We can hang up our wheel whackers at that point.” ",NCA NewsWire,,"June 3, 2021"

The ACCC is alleging the antivirus garments were a false and misleading claim to consumers with no scientific study implemented to determine if the activewear could stop the spread of COVID-19. It is also alleging the company’s chief executive Lorna Jane Clarkson was well aware the products did not combat the virus and made personal false claims by spruiking the clothes on social media and in testimonials.

Most of the claims were removed in mid-July, but the ACCC says Lorna Jane continued to run the false representations on garment tags until at least November. ACCC commissioner Sarah Court said the claims were not backed by any scientific evidence and took advantage of vulnerable consumers, particularly Victorians who were battling a second wave of the virus. “We allege that the statements made by Lorna Jane gave the impression that the COVID-19 claims were based on scientific or technological evidence when this was not the case,” Ms Court said.

In this case, 200,000 more people died than in a regular year – a figure 54,000 higher than the official coronavirus death toll from the same period. RELATED: Trump’s New Zealand sledge Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has warned the real virus death toll is probably much higher. Picture: Kevin Dietsch/AFPSource:AFP RELATED: Dry weather could increase virus risk Experts have long warned that America’s death toll is underestimating the number of victims. “The number is likely higher. I don’t know exactly what per cent higher, but almost certainly it’s higher,” Dr Anthony Fauci said back in May. “Because given the situation, particularly in New York City, when they were really strapped with a very serious challenge to their healthcare system, there may have been people who died at home who did have COVID, who were not counted as COVID because they never really got to the hospital.” BRAZIL Brazil is the only other country to surpass 100,000 deaths, but it shows no signs of locking down as cities and restaurants reopen. Its leader, Jair Bolsonaro, has infamously dismissed the virus as a “little flu”, despite 50,000 people dying in three months – followed by another 50,000 in just 50 days. The country has so far recorded more than 3.3 million cases and the death toll sits at 108,536. The Brazilian President’s handling of the pandemic has been criticised by both its Supreme Court and Congress, but he insists on prioritising the economy over health concerns. In a Facebook video that streamed earlier this month, Mr Bolsonaro, who tested positive for the disease himself back in July, said: “I regret all the deaths. It’s already reaching the number 100,000, but we are going to find a way out of that.” RELATED: Italy’s remarkable virus recovery Brazil is one of just two countries to pass 100,000 deaths.

Compared to the US and Brazil, India has reported a relatively low number of deaths, at around 51,000, although epidemiologists say the peak of its outbreak could be months away. Cases in India have been spreading from urban areas to smaller towns and the countryside, where health infrastructure is already overburdened. India started a phased reopening after a strict lockdown that was imposed on March 25. Temples and other places of worship were allowed to open in June. Places of worship draw many thousands of people in India and premises are often cramped, making social distancing difficult.

His announcement about the vaccine was met with caution from scientists and WHO, with experts saying it still needed a rigorous safety review. “The first batch of the novel coronavirus vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute has been produced,” the health ministry said in a statement quoted by Russian news agencies.

Trump, in his desperation and sinking polls, uses racism as his last ditch effort to save his floundering campaign. Last month, Mr Trump scrapped the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing provision of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, a move he claimed would protect property values in the suburbs. He shared an op-ed in the New York Post that criticised Mr Biden’s plan for housing, and tweeted: “The Suburban Housewives of America must read this article.

75,Crown Resorts should not be given gaming licence says probe recommendations,"A probe into Crown has dealt a crushing blow to its $2.2bn Barangaroo project after damning allegations of bad corporate behaviour. A probe into Crown Resorts has recommended the embattled gaming giant have its Sydney casino licence revoked, in a crippling blow to its $2.2bn Barangaroo project.","['finance', 'business', 'other industries'] []","In a report tabled to the state parliament, the NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) said corporate “arrogance” was a driving factor in the company turning a blind eye to illegal money laundering within its Melbourne and Perth venues. ILGA in its findings said the James Packer-backed casino was not a suitable licensee holder and its state gaming clearance should be revoked. Media reports in 2019 alleged Crown facilitated money laundering activities at its Melbourne and Perth casinos through Asian high-roller junkets, sparking questions over whether it was fit to hold the licence. ILGA has recommended Crown Sydney should not be granted a gaming licence. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Flavio BrancaleoneSource:News Corp Australia Crown’s serious corporate failures included the arrest of employees in China in 2016 “with numerous failures to escalate indicators of real risks to the staff”, the report said. “Any applicant for a casino licence with the attributes of Crown’s stark realities of facilitating money laundering, exposing staff to the risk of detention in a foreign jurisdiction and pursuing commercial relationships with individuals with connections to triads and organised crime groups would not be confident of a positive outcome,” the report said. Commissioner Patricia Bergin said in her findings there was “significant deficiency” in Crown’s corporate character and a lack of understanding and compliance of the country’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws (AML/CTF). “Every single Crown director should have been versed in an understanding at the very least of: the methods by which money launderers can infiltrate and exploit the operations of the casino,” the report said. Commissioner Patricia Bergin in her findings said there was ‘significant deficiency’ in Crown’s corporate character.Source:Supplied During hearings, evidence pointed to Crown trying to rectify the issue by implementing a slapdash one-hour training session on AML/CTF laws. Ms Bergin said Crown’s character would never satisfy ILGA while it failed to implement proper measures to address the rise of money laundering within casinos. ILGA also found numerous governance failings by senior management and the board, including Mr Packer, who ignored criminal risks when trying to get Casino giant Melco to buy part of his stake in Crown. The report said “amazingly”, Mr Packer “did not turn his mind to the prospect” of the late Stanley Ho – who allegedly had underworld connections – having an interest in Hong Kong casino giant Melco, which planned to buy a 19.9 per cent interest in Crown. The inquiry heard Mr Packer was insistent the Melco deal go through, but it only ended up buying 10 per cent, dumping its plans to buy the second tranche in February last year, then offloading its interest to US private equity giant Blackstone in April. “The fact that Melco sold its shares and since April 2020 is no longer a shareholder and the fact that Mr Stanley Ho is now deceased, does not mean that it was unnecessary to explore these matters further.” Ms Bergin’s findings also found numerous failing of governance by senior management and the board, including James Packer.Source:Supplied Mr Packer’s “forgetfulness or failing to turn one’s mind” to ensuring casinos remained free from criminal influence “must surely be intolerable”. The inquiry also heard Mr Packer was given special treatment — getting privileged information through a controlling shareholder protocol agreement — despite quitting the board in 2018. Mr Packer’s special treatment agreement was terminated during the inquiry, so it was now a “stock standard” relationship, Crown’s lead lawyer Neil Young said. Counsel assisting the inquiry had argued Mr Packer should have no association with the Barangaroo venue at all due to prior poor behaviour. Mr Packer making a “very serious threat against a business colleague” in 2015 “demonstrates a flaw in his character such as to adversely affect his integrity”, the report read. His lieutenant Michael Johnston – an executive of his private investment vehicle Consolidated Press Holdings and a Crown director for the past 13 years — was found to have exacerbated the corporate governance failings at the group. ILGA in its findings said the James Packer-backed casino was not a suitable licensee holder and its state gaming clearance should be revoked. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Joel CarrettSource:News Corp Australia Ms Bergin’s report also took aim at chief executive Ken Barton for advocating to keep the Riverbank subsidiary account open without investigating possible connections to money laundering. “The authority would be justified in concluding that it cannot have any confidence in dealing with Mr Barton as a director of the licensee or Crown,” the report said. Chair Helen Coonan was exonerated of wrongdoing but the report said her understanding of the issues plaguing Crown was heavily reliant on Mr Barton’s advice and judgment. It was also noted ILGA had no confidence in Crown director Andrew Demetriou, who during testimonies provided a “most unedifying” and “quite bizarre performance” by reading from notes on the witness stand. The probe heard Australian Resorts chief executive Barry Felstead was warned in 2015 about staff being concerned for their safety and living in “constant fear of getting tapped on the shoulder” as they sought to lure Chinese high rollers to Crown’s Australian casinos. Media reports in 2019 alleged Crown facilitated money laundering activities at its Melbourne and Perth casinos. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Penny StephensSource:News Corp Australia But that information never made it through to the board or risk management committee, and 16 of the employees ended up serving jail time. Earlier on Tuesday, Crown began preparing for a potential investor backlash following the public release of the report, placing its shares into a trading halt. The report said an enforceable undertaking could be committed, however ILGA would not be satisfied while Guy Jalland and Michael Johnston remain as company directors. “If Crown is to survive this turmoil and convert itself into a company that can be regarded as a suitable person and achieve the same for the licensee, there is little doubt that it could achieve a fresh start and emerge a very much stronger and better organisation,” the report said. Crown prepared for a potential investor backlash by placing its shares into a trading halt. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Penny StephensSource:News Corp Australia NSW Customer Service Minister Victor Dominello said he would consider the recommendations before formally responding. “At the heart of the report is a relationship between organised crime, money laundering and gambling. And more importantly what steps we can do to protect the community against these sinister elements,” he said earlier in the day. An opposition spokeswoman said the report was “damning” and Labor would request a hearing with Mr Dominello. Independent MP and anti-gambling campaigner Andrew Wilkie said the findings had implications for Crown’s casinos in Melbourne and Perth. “Surely it’s self-evident that Commissioner Bergin’s findings mean the company is unfit to continue to operate any casino in Australia,” Mr Wilkie said. “To that end I call upon the premiers of Victoria and Western Australia to suspend Crown’s casino licences in their jurisdictions, and to immediately establish commissions of inquiry to get to the bottom of what is now a genuinely national issue. “I also call on the Prime Minister to revisit my repeated calls in the federal parliament for a royal commission into the casino industry.” Crown said in a statement lodged to the Australian Securities Exchange it reviewing ILGA’s report.

76,Coronavirus: Australia is a cautionary tale for COVID resurgence,"Australia was once heralded for its early response in containing COVID-19. Now, we’re being presented as a cautionary tale.  Where Australia was once heralded for our early response in containing COVID-19, we’re now being presented as a cautionary tale of how the virus spreads when countries get “complacent”.","['world', 'coronavirus', 'australia'] ['coronavirus']","Earlier this week, The Wall Street Journal listed Australia as a key country where “coronavirus is back with a vengeance” after it “had all but vanished”. “Most of Australia has enjoyed prolonged spells without locally-transmitted infections. The relative speed at which the initial outbreak was contained and the low mortality rate, public health experts say, may have contributed to a sense of complacency by the time the second wave hit, despite constant government warnings,” the article said. RELATED:  Follow our live coronavirus coverage here  President Donald Trump quoted the WSJ during his press conference on Friday, highlighting Australia among a list of countries now suffering through a “second wave”. “A resurgence has taken place in many countries that people thought were doing well. Despite a wide range of approaches to the pandemic, this resurgence in cases is occurring throughout large portions of our planet – in Japan, China, Australia, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Hong Kong – places where they thought they’d really done great,” he said at a press conference today. “It came back, and in a couple of cases came back very strongly.” The President went on: “The virus was said to be under control but new cases have risen very significantly once again. So when you think someone is doing well, sometimes you have to hold your decision on that.” US President Donald Trump said Australia was among a list of key countries now suffering through a ‘second wave’. Picture: Jim Watson/AFPSource:AFP The comparison faced criticism on social media, with many pointing out that Australia’s rise in cases – horrifying as it is – is not nearly on the same scale as that of the United States. The truth is, many countries are now struggling to contain the pandemic – albeit at vastly different numbers, and in different ways. AUSTRALIA’S SITUATION IS INCREASINGLY DIRE Mr Trump’s depiction of Australia was accurate – the data shows just how dire the situation is here. Over the first week of June, Australia recorded an average of 10 new cases per day, according to government data. Over the past week, there has been an average of 385 new cases reported each day, meaning the average new case numbers are now 38.5 times higher than they were two months ago. This has largely been driven by the spike in Victoria, which marked a record high of 723 cases on Thursday, followed by a dip to 627 on Friday. On Friday, the state surpassed 10,000 cases, and from Monday mandatory mask rules will be statewide. New South Wales has recorded its biggest increase in months. Picture: Peter Parks/AFPSource:AFP New South Wales also recorded its biggest increase in months, with 21 cases announced on Friday. There are currently over 100 active cases being treated by NSW Health, and a series of clusters spread all over Sydney. Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist and Adviser to the World Health Organisation, says the state is now “in the red zone” in its coronavirus fight. Writing in The Conversation, she said a state’s progress can be determined by looking at rolling 14-day cumulative cases, which represents roughly two incubation periods. “My analysis of the data suggests when cases reach 100 over 14 days – the ‘red zone’ – then an outbreak becomes very difficult to control. This happened in Victoria on June 18, before cases skyrocketed and a second lockdown was called for July 8,” she said. “Over the last fortnight, NSW has recorded at least 154 new cases (minus international arrivals in quarantine), which is very concerning.” TIME FOR A NEW STRATEGY? Economics Professor Richard Holden said Australia should seriously consider elimination rather than suppression, noting aged care facilities are under serious threat. Elimination and suppression strategies employ the same control measures, including efficient contact tracing, social distancing and border controls. Victoria marked a record high number of cases on Thursday. Picture: Asanka Ratnayake/Getty ImagesSource:Getty Images The difference is that a suppression strategy – which Australia has followed – might enforce physical distancing requirements until community transmission falls beneath a certain point, while a New Zealand-style elimination strategy sees these measures in place until there’s no detectable community transmission. “The dreadful events playing out in these facilities also remind us why we need to functionally eliminate all local transmission in Australian states and territories,” Prof Holden said. “If even a relatively small number of cases are in the community, this terribly infectious disease will spread unless the reproduction rate is kept below 1. “The inevitable result is that some of the most vulnerable Australians – people who have contributed to this country all their lives – will die in large numbers and in terrible conditions.” US CASES ARE NOT SLOWING DOWN All that said, if Australia’s current situation is bad, America’s is off the charts, with more than 4.5 million cases – more than 25 per cent of the global total. In his press conferences, Mr Trump has repeatedly suggested the US is working to get the pandemic under control. “We’re working very hard to contain this horrible event … and we’re making a lot of strides,” he said on Friday, before immediately launching into a spiel about how the world is “having tremendous problems”. He referenced countries now struggling with a second resurgence of the virus – Hong Kong, China, Japan, and countries across western Europe. But the situation in the US is far from ideal – and there’s been little to suggest its government has a solid plan in motion. On Thursday, the country reported 69,312 confirmed infections. Florida, Arizona and Missisippi counted record single-day death numbers. The country reported over 1000 deaths for four straight days this past week, while the country’s economy shrank 9.5 per cent from April through June – the biggest quarterly rate drop in modern record-keeping. Mr Trump has repeatedly said the US is “in the process of developing a very powerful strategy” to deal with the pandemic. But when asked what and where this strategy was, he did not directly respond. “Well, I think you’re seeing it, and I think you will see it. And one of the things that we’ve done that we’re getting – and it hasn’t been utilised fully yet – but we’re all set to march when it comes to the vaccine,” he said. He ignored an interjecting question on how the Trump administration was actually slowing the spread of the virus. “The delivery system is all set, logistically. We have a general that – that’s all he does, is deliver things, whether it’s soldiers or other items. And I think you’re going to see something that’s going to be spectacular.” ",news.com.au,,"August 13, 2020"

While it’s expected that Aucklanders will most likely stay in lockdown for longer than three days, a worst-case scenario would mean it could be seven weeks, a top scientist warned. Epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker told The New Zealand Herald it all came down to determining how far this outbreak had already spread and if a direct link to an overseas case could be identified. “You would expect a longer lockdown would be more likely. The most positive outcome is if contact tracing identifies a clear line of transmission from an imported case or someone working at managed quarantine,” Prof Baker said. “If the direct line to imported cases is established quickly, that’s very helpful and then it’s finding out the extent of infection among the contacts. If some of them are infected then it’s working out the extent of infection among their contacts, and so it goes on.” RELATED: Top health official slams suggestion NZ too ‘soft’ RELATED: Ardern slams virus conspiracy theory Experts say New Zealand could stay in lockdown for up to seven weeks.

The United States is the hardest hit country for COVID-19, with more infections and deaths than any other nation.","['world', 'coronavirus', 'global'] ['coronavirus']","There are currently over 4.37 million coronavirus cases and 150,000 deaths in the US. On a per capita basis, the US – which has a population of 328.2 million – is still one of the worst-hit countries in the world, with just four countries ahead of it. Oman, Bahrain, Panama and South Africa are the top four worst-hit countries on a per capita basis, according to a New York Times analysis that measures new daily cases per million residents. Countries that initially saw bad early outbreaks, such as South Korea, Italy and Spain, are now seeing relatively low infection rates, with schools and businesses reopening. But the surge in the United States is so extreme that, once adjusted for population, there are 10 states now recording more new cases than any country in the world – led overwhelmingly by Florida.

To put this into perspective, Oman has a population of just over five million people. The ministry also reported nine new fatalities from the virus, bringing the death toll to 393. Cases first appeared in the country in February, after two Omani women returned from virus-ravaged Iran. A month later, the total number of cases surged to 100, and by April the country was recording deaths. On June 1, the total number of cases crossed 12,000, which the country’s health minister Dr Ahmed Al Saidi attributed to various Ramadan and Eid gatherings. “If you look at the figures, the cases began to increase during the second half of Ramadan and then it just shot up during Eid because people are flouting the social distancing rules and they are still gathering. This is a serious concern. The numbers have increased over the last few days because of this,” Dr Al Saidi said. Bahrain has a huge number of asymptomatic virus carriers. Picture: Mazen Mahdi/AFPSource:AFP BAHRAIN Bahrain currently has a total of 39,131 cases, with a relatively low fatality rate of 0.34 per cent. A recent study found that the number of asymptomatic people was at 68 per cent. These results reflect both the wider problems faced by Gulf Arab countries reliant on cheap foreign labour and their relative success in tracking their COVID-19 outbreaks, given their oil wealth and authoritarian governments. The country relies heavily on foreign workers – a trait which appears to have contributed to the spread of the virus there. Of the more than 6000 contact trace cases that Bahrain published, more than 2600 involved Indian nationals, while 1310 were Bahrainis and 1260 were Bangladeshis.

The ACCC is alleging the antivirus garments were a false and misleading claim to consumers with no scientific study implemented to determine if the activewear could stop the spread of COVID-19. It is also alleging the company’s chief executive Lorna Jane Clarkson was well aware the products did not combat the virus and made personal false claims by spruiking the clothes on social media and in testimonials.

Where Australia was once heralded for our early response in containing COVID-19, we’re now being presented as a cautionary tale of how the virus spreads when countries get “complacent”.","['world', 'coronavirus', 'australia'] ['coronavirus']","Earlier this week, The Wall Street Journal listed Australia as a key country where “coronavirus is back with a vengeance” after it “had all but vanished”. “Most of Australia has enjoyed prolonged spells without locally-transmitted infections. The relative speed at which the initial outbreak was contained and the low mortality rate, public health experts say, may have contributed to a sense of complacency by the time the second wave hit, despite constant government warnings,” the article said. RELATED:  Follow our live coronavirus coverage here  President Donald Trump quoted the WSJ during his press conference on Friday, highlighting Australia among a list of countries now suffering through a “second wave”. “A resurgence has taken place in many countries that people thought were doing well. Despite a wide range of approaches to the pandemic, this resurgence in cases is occurring throughout large portions of our planet – in Japan, China, Australia, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Hong Kong – places where they thought they’d really done great,” he said at a press conference today. “It came back, and in a couple of cases came back very strongly.” The President went on: “The virus was said to be under control but new cases have risen very significantly once again. So when you think someone is doing well, sometimes you have to hold your decision on that.” US President Donald Trump said Australia was among a list of key countries now suffering through a ‘second wave’. Picture: Jim Watson/AFPSource:AFP The comparison faced criticism on social media, with many pointing out that Australia’s rise in cases – horrifying as it is – is not nearly on the same scale as that of the United States. The truth is, many countries are now struggling to contain the pandemic – albeit at vastly different numbers, and in different ways. AUSTRALIA’S SITUATION IS INCREASINGLY DIRE Mr Trump’s depiction of Australia was accurate – the data shows just how dire the situation is here. Over the first week of June, Australia recorded an average of 10 new cases per day, according to government data. Over the past week, there has been an average of 385 new cases reported each day, meaning the average new case numbers are now 38.5 times higher than they were two months ago. This has largely been driven by the spike in Victoria, which marked a record high of 723 cases on Thursday, followed by a dip to 627 on Friday. On Friday, the state surpassed 10,000 cases, and from Monday mandatory mask rules will be statewide. New South Wales has recorded its biggest increase in months. Picture: Peter Parks/AFPSource:AFP New South Wales also recorded its biggest increase in months, with 21 cases announced on Friday. There are currently over 100 active cases being treated by NSW Health, and a series of clusters spread all over Sydney. Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist and Adviser to the World Health Organisation, says the state is now “in the red zone” in its coronavirus fight. Writing in The Conversation, she said a state’s progress can be determined by looking at rolling 14-day cumulative cases, which represents roughly two incubation periods. “My analysis of the data suggests when cases reach 100 over 14 days – the ‘red zone’ – then an outbreak becomes very difficult to control. This happened in Victoria on June 18, before cases skyrocketed and a second lockdown was called for July 8,” she said. “Over the last fortnight, NSW has recorded at least 154 new cases (minus international arrivals in quarantine), which is very concerning.” TIME FOR A NEW STRATEGY? Economics Professor Richard Holden said Australia should seriously consider elimination rather than suppression, noting aged care facilities are under serious threat. Elimination and suppression strategies employ the same control measures, including efficient contact tracing, social distancing and border controls. Victoria marked a record high number of cases on Thursday. Picture: Asanka Ratnayake/Getty ImagesSource:Getty Images The difference is that a suppression strategy – which Australia has followed – might enforce physical distancing requirements until community transmission falls beneath a certain point, while a New Zealand-style elimination strategy sees these measures in place until there’s no detectable community transmission. “The dreadful events playing out in these facilities also remind us why we need to functionally eliminate all local transmission in Australian states and territories,” Prof Holden said. “If even a relatively small number of cases are in the community, this terribly infectious disease will spread unless the reproduction rate is kept below 1. “The inevitable result is that some of the most vulnerable Australians – people who have contributed to this country all their lives – will die in large numbers and in terrible conditions.” US CASES ARE NOT SLOWING DOWN All that said, if Australia’s current situation is bad, America’s is off the charts, with more than 4.5 million cases – more than 25 per cent of the global total. In his press conferences, Mr Trump has repeatedly suggested the US is working to get the pandemic under control. “We’re working very hard to contain this horrible event … and we’re making a lot of strides,” he said on Friday, before immediately launching into a spiel about how the world is “having tremendous problems”. He referenced countries now struggling with a second resurgence of the virus – Hong Kong, China, Japan, and countries across western Europe. But the situation in the US is far from ideal – and there’s been little to suggest its government has a solid plan in motion. On Thursday, the country reported 69,312 confirmed infections. Florida, Arizona and Missisippi counted record single-day death numbers. The country reported over 1000 deaths for four straight days this past week, while the country’s economy shrank 9.5 per cent from April through June – the biggest quarterly rate drop in modern record-keeping. Mr Trump has repeatedly said the US is “in the process of developing a very powerful strategy” to deal with the pandemic. But when asked what and where this strategy was, he did not directly respond. “Well, I think you’re seeing it, and I think you will see it. And one of the things that we’ve done that we’re getting – and it hasn’t been utilised fully yet – but we’re all set to march when it comes to the vaccine,” he said. He ignored an interjecting question on how the Trump administration was actually slowing the spread of the virus. “The delivery system is all set, logistically. We have a general that – that’s all he does, is deliver things, whether it’s soldiers or other items. And I think you’re going to see something that’s going to be spectacular.” ",news.com.au,,"August 13, 2020"

At the same time, we have incurred higher expenses due to increased resourcing to handle unprecedented COVID-19 demands and fixing our compliance issues.” The bank said capital buffers remained robust to cope with the pressures influenced by the pandemic, with decisions to resume dividend payments in line with guidelines set by the prudential regulator. Westpac is anticipating its financial performance will improve throughout 2021 and 2022. Mr King noted impairment costs in the second half of the financial year had declined due to less one-off payments, and expected levels of bad debts were better than expected. Westpac still has 41,000 home loan repayments on deferral due to the health crisis, which equates to about $16.6 billion, and 4300 small business loans remain suspended at a value of $1 billion.

Picture: NCA NewsWire / Jono SearleSource:News Corp Australia “We remain in an uncertain economic environment; however, the recent budget has provided significant stimulus to businesses and households,” Mr King said. “Our economists expect at least half the personal tax cuts will be spent and businesses will respond to the generous depreciation allowances.” Mr King, who became chief executive following the abrupt end of Brian Hartzer’s reign after the AUSTRAC scandal, said the bank was making progress in overhauling its risk compliance regarding anti-money laundering laws. In November last year, AUSTRAC revealed Westpac failed to report millions of suspicious banking transactions, resulting in 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. “We have taken accountability for our mistakes and commenced a process of fundamental change, which has included refreshing the board and management and elevating oversight of financial crime, compliance and conduct,” Mr King said. Moody’s Investor Service vice president Daniel Yu said impairment charges were four times the size of the prior year, but the banking group remained well capitalised. “Despite these pressures, Westpac’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio improved to a healthy 11.13 per cent and the bank’s dividend payout ratio of 49 per cent of fiscal 2020 statutory profit is the maximum allowable under APRA’s guidance,” Mr Yu said. Investment analysts at brokerage Citi said the fall in earnings was 10 per cent above expectations. ",NCA NewsWire,,"November 2, 2020"

91,Woolworths posts profit rise due to elevated sales during the coronavirus pandemic,"One of the country’s largest supermarket retailers has posted a major bump in profit due to the ongoing shift to essential spending during the pandemic.  Woolworths says increased spending on groceries and at-home entertainment during the coronavirus pandemic has boosted its bottom line, allowing it to increase its interim dividend payout to shareholders. ","['finance', 'business', 'retail'] []","The supermarket and retailing giant posted a net profit after tax for the first half of 2021 financial year of $1.135bn, a 28 per cent jump on the same period last year. Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci said the first half of the current financial year was still impacted by COVID-19 and prompted a continuation of the spending shift towards essential goods and services. “The first half … continued to be impacted by COVID, with elevated sales and higher costs as we worked to maintain a COVIDSafe environment for our customers and team,” Mr Banducci said. “While we have all been living in this uncertain environment now for 12 months, ongoing localised outbreaks remind us that we need to remain both vigilant and agile.” Elevated sales in core businesses such as supermarkets, drinks and BigW were able to offset the higher incurred costs of the pandemic and the major slump in trading within its hotels division. Woolworths CEO Brad Banducci noted a spending shift towards essential goods and services. Picture: John Feder/The AustralianSource:News Corp Australia Sales at Woolworths Metro stores over the period were lower as a result of less foot traffic in CBD locations, declining 6.7 per cent to $456m. Mr Banducci said the company had made no decision on axing any CBD sites but was monitoring Metro store performance. “It is an ongoing question for us,” he said. “We have unfortunately had to (already) mothball a number of our Metro stores.” Group earnings before tax and interest rose 10.5 per cent over the period to $2.09bn. Total revenue rose 10.6 per cent to $38.85bn, with the company noting stronger supermarket sales and at-home consumption of alcohol and entertainment, as a result of the pandemic, had prompted a rise in turnover. “ (BigW) Sales increased in all destination areas and were buoyed by seasonal sales events such as Halloween, Click Frenzy, Big Sale (Black Friday) and Christmas,” Mr Banducci said. Mr Banducci also noted BigW digital activity over the period had surpassed in-store foot traffic for the first time. Woolworths declared an interim dividend of 53 cents per share, with approximately $671m being returned to shareholders. It is a 15.2 per cent jump on last year’s dividend. Woolworths chair Gordon Cairns said the group was on track for its liquor business Endeavour Drinks to be spun out by June this year. “We had previously indicated that we were targeting calendar 2021 for a potential separation of Endeavour Group.

100,Qantas delays start to international travel,Australia’s biggest airline has flagged yet another delay to the highly-anticipated restart of international travel.  Qantas has pushed back its start date for international flights and is pinning its hopes on travel bubbles beyond the arrangement in place with New Zealand.,"['travel', 'travel updates', 'health & safety'] []","The major airline has been forced to move back its planned resumption of international passenger operations from the end of October to the end of December. The decision is in light of the federal government delaying the anticipated time frame for completion of the vaccine rollout to the end of the year and international borders not fully reopening until mid-2022. “We remain optimistic that additional bubbles will open once Australia’s vaccine rollout is complete to countries who, by then, are in a similar position, but it’s difficult to predict which ones at this stage,” a Qantas spokeswoman said. The airline says it remains optimistic. Picture: NCA NewsWire/James GourleySource:News Corp Australia “We will keep reviewing these plans as we move towards December and circumstances evolve.” Qantas had begun taking bookings for all international flights starting October 31. The airline confirmed customers who made bookings for the October to December period would be directly contacted and issued either a credit, refund or the option to re-book. Qantas said it would continue to provide overseas repatriation and freight flights while travel remained off the cards. It noted the international booking levels were relatively low for the period and its increase in domestic operations was crucial to its financial recovery. “The resurgence of domestic travel remains the most important element of the group’s recovery,” the company said.

101,Coronavirus: The countries that defeated COVID-19,Only a handful of countries around the world have successfully managed to defeat COVID-19. Here’s how they did it.  Only a small number of countries have successfully managed to eliminate COVID-19. ,"['world', 'coronavirus', 'global'] ['Jacinda Ardern', 'coronavirus']","New Zealand, Fiji, Mongolia and Taiwan are among the few that have not recorded a single case of coronavirus in local communities for a relatively sustained period of time. Some states and territories in Australia are in a similar position to New Zealand; the Northern Territory, Tasmania and Western Australia have gone months without recording any new locally acquired cases. Tasmania and the ACT have gone almost two weeks without a single active case. But Australia as a whole is experiencing a worrying new wave of the virus, with Victoria leading a massive resurgence, and New South Wales a smaller one. Here’s how the other countries did it. NEW ZEALAND With a population of five million, New Zealand won widespread praise for its effective handling of the coronavirus pandemic since closing its borders on March 19. The World Health Organisation (WHO) hailed the country as an example to others for having “successfully eliminated community transmission”. Since the first patient was diagnosed in February, there have been 1219 confirmed cases of the virus in New Zealand with the last case of community transmission recorded on May 1. As a result, New Zealanders are enjoying a near-normal, pre-coronavirus lifestyle with no social distancing and spectators allowed at sports and cultural events, but with the border strictly controlled and all arrivals required to spend 14 days in quarantine. Jacinda Ardern’s government has maintained the prospect of a second wave remains a possibility and is pushing for all households to keep emergency supply kits, including masks, on hand. A key difference between New Zealand’s and Australia’s approach to the virus is that one implemented an elimination strategy – which it pursued aggressively – while the other pushed for suppression. New Zealand’s elimination approach allowed it to squash the virus completely, which has since seen the reopening of the country’s economy.

Picture: Phil Walter/Getty ImagesSource:Getty Images TAIWAN Taiwan has a similar population to Australia – but the smaller island is much more densely populated and closer to China. The country successfully implemented a massive testing and contact tracing program early on, while quarantining people and isolating the sick. On January 20, the country activated a Central Epidemic Command Centre to co-ordinate co-operation across various governments and ministries. It integrated with police agencies, local officials and telecom companies to maximise the country’s response. Taiwan has recorded less than 500 infections since the pandemic began, and only seven deaths. Unlike surrounding countries, it has so far successfully avoided a second resurgence of the virus. RELATED: China-Taiwan tensions escalate Taiwan, under President Tsai Ing-wen, has had just seven deaths from the virus. Picture: Taiwan Presidential Office/AFPSource:AFP FIJI Fiji announced its first death from COVID-19 on July 31 – a man who tested positive after returning from India, where he had travelled for surgery. Before then, Fiji had enjoyed a spell of four weeks virus-free, after the 18 cases it had previously recorded all recovered. Fiji and other Pacific Island nations were initially seen as among the world’s most vulnerable to the virus because of under-resourced health infrastructure and high rates of health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. However, nations in the region acted swiftly and made the costly decision to seal borders, shutting down the tourism trade that powered their economies in order to protect their populations. Fijian Health Minister Ifereimi Waqainabete said there is no risk of local infection, noting the man who died had “zero interaction” with the general public. “In many other countries, news of the first death due to the virus has signalled an intensifying of the outbreak,” he said. “This is not the case for Fiji. The virus is not present in Fijian communities, nor is there any risk of infection among the Fijian public.” MONGOLIA Mongolia’s proximity to China may make it surprising that it appeared on this list, but like Taiwan, its government acted early and efficiently. From January, the Mongolian government enforced various public health measures including universal mask-wearing and handwashing, restricting international travel and banning major public gatherings.

Rattle snakes are squatting in Qantas planes stranded in the Californian desert, prompting crews to come up with new ways to combat the slithering reptiles. ","['travel', 'travel updates'] []","Engineers looking after the airline’s A380 fleet in the Mojave Desert while it is grounded due to Covid-19 are whacking away snakes and scorpions calling plane wheels home. The “wheel whacker” is the latest tool crafted by crews based at the airline’s Los Angeles hanger to help them solve the problem. Rattle snakes are making homes of Qantas A380s parked in the Mojave Desert in California. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied Qantas’ LA engineering manager, Tim Heywood, said weekly maintenance is paramount to ensuring the planes are ready to bring in for service, however storing the A380s in the desert has uncovered a venomous hazard. “The area is well-known for its feisty rattlers who love to curl up around the warm rubber tyres and in the aircrafts’ wheels and brakes,” Mr Heywood said. “We’ve encountered a few rattle snakes and also some scorpions, but the wheel whacker does its job and they scuttle off.” Qantas engineers have developed ’wheel whackers’ to scare off rattlesnakes during A380 maintenance procedures. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied The wheel whacker is a repurposed broom, with each aircraft designated its own hitter complete with the plane’s registration number. A bulk of the world’s planes has been placed in the Mojave Desert for deep storage while travel numbers remain minimal during the pandemic. The A380 fleet is not expected to be brought back into service at least for another two years. Deserts are the prime storage place for planes due to the dry heat and little to no humidity, however the famous US desert is littered with highly venomous rattle snakes. Airlines are well equipped to deal with birds and insects nesting in crevices within planes, but the widescale 2020 grounding has created a new wave of critters looking to find a warm place to live.

Mr Heywood said this unique part of the weekly inspection is further evidence of how strange the past year has been for the aviation industry, especially for the A380 fleet which normally would rarely spend more than 24 hours on the ground. Mr Heywood noted the whackers are to ensure no harm comes to either the engineers or the snakes. “The first thing we do before we unwrap and start any ground inspection of the landing gear in particular is to walk around the aircraft stomping our feet and tapping the wheels with a wheel whacker to wake up and scare off the snakes,” he said. Snakes and scorpions are making plane wheels their home because of the warmth.

It is the first time in 290 days a Qantas A380 has been in the sky. Before the pandemic a number of the airline’s A380s were refurbished but have not yet been used in service. “Aircraft like these are highly technical and you can’t just land it at the storage facility, park it and walk away,” Mr Heywood said. “Some of these aircraft have brand-new interiors still with the plastic on the seats, so we are proud to keep them in top-notch condition until the time comes for them to fly again. “We can hang up our wheel whackers at that point.” ",NCA NewsWire,,"June 3, 2021"

Mr Trump, 74, and Mr Biden, 77, are both in a high risk category for having more severe symptoms from the virus, because of their age. During the debate, moderator Chris Wallace asked Mr Trump about his position on masks. “President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer,” Wallace said. “And in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the efficacy of masks?” “No, I think masks are okay,” Mr Trump replied. “You have to understand, if you look … I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. “Tonight, as an example, everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks …” “Just like your rally,” Mr Biden said. “ … when needed. When needed, I wear masks,” Mr Trump said. Mr Trump then continued: “I don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen.” Mr Biden responded, and started talking about reopening businesses. “Well, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters.

We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people.” When asked if he was worried about the disease, Mr Trump said, “Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It’s outside. “That’s a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. “And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace.” Mr Biden fired back at this point, saying Mr Trump had been concerned about being infected by his fans. “By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had,” Mr Biden said. “A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, ‘No, no, no. Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I’m way far away from those other people’. “That’s what he said, ‘I’m going to be okay’. He’s not worried about you. He’s not worried about the people out there.” Mr Trump insisted there’d been no “negative effect” at various rallies, which he said had been attended by up to 35,000 and 40,000 people. “He’s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to,” Mr Biden said. “He’s a fool on this.” “If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing,” Mr Trump said as a final shot. “But you can’t.

That’s why we are (saying) all childcare centres should have cameras in playing areas,’’ she said. “My request is that proper actions should (be taken) to prevent this – like installing cameras in play areas and increasing the number of staff in childcare centres. “Try to avoid dangerous play equipment – there should be proper inspections to make sure of safety.” At the time, police described the boy’s death as a tragic accident. WorkSafe confirmed it wouldn’t prosecute the death – after a lengthy investigation in 2017 cleared the centre of wrongdoing.

110,Australia’s unemployment rate in November drops to 6.8 per cent,"The latest unemployment figures have been revealed, with 90,000 more Australians finding work in November.  Australia’s unemployment rate has fallen to 6.8 per cent, with 90,000 new workers finding jobs during the month of November. ","['finance', 'work'] []","Latest labour data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveals the majority of new jobs were picked up in Victoria, with the southern state adding 74,000 new positions. The participation rate – the number of people employed or looking for a job – increased by 0.3 per cent over the month. Unemployment numbers dropped by 17,300 people. The fall comes after a slight increase in unemployment in October to 7 per cent, with 25,500 people over the period becoming jobless. ABS head of labour statistics Bjorn Jarvis said there were still 138,000 fewer people employed since March and 226,000 Australians unemployed in that time. “Early in the COVID period we saw large flows of people out of the labour force – 666,000 people between March and May – and the participation rate fell 3.3 percentage points over the two months,” Mr Jarvis said. Mr Jarvis noted Victoria’s labour market was catching up with the rest of the country. Picture: Daniel Pockett/ Getty ImagesSource:Getty Images Mr Jarvis noted Victoria’s labour market was catching up with the rest of the country following the easing of shutdown measures in the southern state. “The gap between Victoria and the rest of Australia has narrowed considerably since September off the back of two consecutive months of strong recovery in employment and hours,” he said. “Hours worked in Victoria also recovered strongly again, increasing by 5.2 per cent, following an increase of 5.6 per cent in October.” CommSec senior economist Ryan Felsman said while the drop was positive, the coronavirus pandemic had scarred the labour market, with roughly 942,100 Australians still out of work. The number of Australians out of work peaked in July with more than a million people actively looking for work. Mr Felsman said unemployment might have already peaked in July at 7.5 per cent. CommSec senior economist Ryan Felsman says unemployment may have already peaked. Picture: supplied.Source:Supplied “Government intervention via wage subsidies – such as JobKeeper – prevented a huge lift in the jobless rate when compared to the large contraction in economic activity in the June quarter,” Mr Felsman said. “But the healing has just begun with the unemployment rate unlikely to fall back to pre-recession levels for at least 12 months or more.” Employment Minister Michaelia Cash said the government was “acutely aware” that the economic and labour market fallout from COVID-19 will continue for some time. “That is why the Morrison Government has committed an unprecedented $507 billion in economic support, to help rebuild the economy and put Australia back on the road to recovery,” Senator Cash said. Aside from Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania have the highest state levels of unemployment at 7.7 per cent and 7.9 per cent respectively. NSW’s unemployment level sits at 6.5 per cent, while the Australian Capital Territory has the lowest jobless rate at 4 per cent. ANZ economists believed unemployment would remain at 7 per cent. More Australians found work last month. Picture: NCA NewsWire / James GourleySource:News Corp Australia “We expect Australia’s labour market data to show employment to have risen 70k, driven by Victoria, but higher participation should see unemployment steady at 7 per cent,” ANZ said in a statement on Thursday morning. Westpac also anticipated the rate to remain flat but noted the participation rate in Victoria would rise higher than other states. Australia’s unemployment rate has sharply risen over 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic; however, the hit to the jobless rate has not been as bad as first anticipated due to a faster economic recovery and federal government support measures such as JobKeeper, which has kept workers employed. The Reserve Bank of Australia initially tipped unemployment to rise to 10 per cent but revised its predictions downwards to a peak rate at just below 8 per cent. The RBA and the federal government have both flagged fiscal stimulus support will need to continue while the unemployment rate is higher than 6 per cent. RBA governor Philip Lowe said unemployment was not expected to dip below 6 per cent until the end of 2022. However, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has a longer outlook. “The unemployment rate is expected to recover to pre-COVID levels in around four years,” he said. “This compares to around six years for the 1980s recession and 10 years for the 1990s recession.” Labor leader Anthony Albanese said it was always good news when people are able to find work. But he said lots of people were underemployed. “You are counted as being employed if you’re doing a couple of hours; what we need to do is to make sure that we have strategies which boost full-time employment,” he said.

Areas in the United States where coronavirus has surged appear to be peaking, with experts saying their case numbers could now begin to drop.","['finance', 'work', 'leaders'] ['Donald Trump', 'coronavirus']","But with this comes a new problem – COVID-19 cases are beginning to rise in other parts of the country. Cases in Florida, Texas, California and Arizona have spiked over the past month, overwhelming hospitals and healthcare workers. “They may be cresting and coming back down,” America’s top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, told Good Morning America. RELATED: Record virus deaths in Florida RELATED: Follow our live coronavirus coverage here  America’s top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, said virus cases may be peaking in some US states. Picture: Al Drago/AFPSource:AFP But he also said there was a “very early indication” that the percentage of positive tests in other states was starting to rise. He noted cases were going up in Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee and Kentucky. “That’s a sure-fire sign that you’ve got to be careful,” he said. The US has the highest number of coronavirus-related cases and deaths in the world, with more than 4.3 million cases and over 148,000 deaths. Dr Fauci also rejected claims by US President Donald Trump that he is “misleading the public” on the virus pandemic, after the leader retweeted a series of messages criticising him. “I don’t even read them, so I don’t really want to go there. I just will continue to do my job no matter what comes out,” Dr Fauci said when asked about the tweets. “Because I think it’s very important. We are in the middle of a crisis with regard to an epidemic, a pandemic. This is what I do. This is what I’ve been trained for my entire professional life and I’ll continue to do it. “I have not been misleading the American public under any circumstances,” he said. FLORIDA HITS RECORD DEATH TOLL Florida’s coronavirus death toll surpassed 6000 on Tuesday as the disease claimed a record 186 lives in its relentless march through the southeast US state, health officials said. The so-called Sunshine State is now second only to California in total number of COVID-19 cases with 441,997, an increase of 9230 from the day before. The latest cases put it ahead of New York, an early epicentre of the global pandemic which has wreaked havoc across the US. The death toll for New York, however, still dwarfs Florida at 32,333, with 22,977 of those in New York City. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has been strongly criticised for his policy forcing nursing homes to admit coronavirus patients. Some 6312 people died in New York nursing homes, or roughly one fifth of all deaths in the state. A report released earlier this month by the state’s Health Commissioner, Dr Howard Zucker, absolved the Cuomo administration over the edict. The widely panned report instead blamed infected nursing home staffers and visitors for spreading the virus. Democratic Assemblyman Ron Kim, however, slammed the report as a “cover-up” and said it was a “conflict of interest for the health department to investigate its own poor decisions”.

Picture: Joe Raedle/Getty Images/AFPSource:AFP In Florida, Tuesday’s death toll was the state’s highest for a single day, although not all fatalities necessarily occurred between Monday and Tuesday. The state’s total deaths from the virus now stand at 6177 while 148,488 people have succumbed nationwide. In Miami, only 8.7 per cent of intensive care beds were available. Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has seen his approval ratings plummet since May when he boasted that the virus was contained and accused the media of sowing panic. A Trump loyalist, Mr DeSantis has refused to require mask-wearing in public, although some mayors have done so in their jurisdictions. Florida, which has no state income taxes and relies on tourist dollars, rushed to attract visitors in May and June as its economy crumbled and the virus appeared to have been contained. New York and Florida have emerged as proxies for a wider battle between Republicans and Democrats over the handling of the pandemic. Trump allies have highlighted New York’s higher death toll than Florida, while opponents predict the southern state’s death toll could soon overtake its northern rival. On cable TV, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo – Andrew Cuomo’s younger brother – has repeatedly attacked Mr DeSantis, accusing him of mishandling the crisis. The Trump campaign, responding to the Cuomo administration’s report into its nursing home policy, earlier this month said that Mr Cuomo “tragically devastated the senior population in New York and no amount (of) revisionist history can erase the governor’s grossly incompetent decisions”. In an interview with PBS earlier this month, however, Dr Fauci heaped praise on New York’s handling of the virus, saying the state did it “correctly”. “We’ve got to do the things that are very clear that we need to do to turn this around,” he said. “We know that, when you do it properly, you bring down those cases. We have done it. We have done it in New York. New York got hit worse than any place in the world.

Mr Nygard is accused of raping girls as young as 14. He hosted Andrew, 60, with his former wife, Sarah, Duchess of York, at his Bahamas estate in the summer of 2000, shortly after the designer had settled cases of sexual harassment against three women out of court in Canada. He has also been photographed with the Duke’s daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. US authorities have charged him with racketeering and sex trafficking. Some 57 women have joined the suit alleging that Mr Nygard trafficked women and girls, and lured victims as young as 14 to “pamper parties” where they were raped.

He is being held in Winnipeg Remand Centre under the Extradition Act with a court appearance expected imminently. There is no suggestion that Andrew was involved in any impropriety, but his decision to maintain links with Mr Nygard is likely to raise eyebrows given his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in prison in August last year after being charged with underage sex trafficking. Prince Andrew, Duke of York visited Mr Nygard in 2000 after he’d settled three cases of harassment out of court. Picture: Tristan Fewings/Getty ImagesSource:Getty Images “We are encouraged that a small measure of justice for Peter Nygard is finally developing,” Greg Gutzler, a lawyer representing complainants said. “But we would be remiss if we did not state that this is something that should have been done decades ago. ”In the original lawsuit filed at the start of this year, ten women accused Mr Nygard of luring them to his mansion with promises of cash and modelling jobs, before sexually assaulting them. Dozens more then came forward with allegations, stretching back as far as 1977.” Several company executives and directors have been accused of enabling the assaults, with claims that Mr Nygard used bribery and intimidation to recruit victims and evade accountability. The plaintiffs are asking for a jury trial and undetermined damages. Earlier this year, two of Mr Nygard’s sons filed a separate lawsuit against him alleging they were statutorily raped as teenagers at his instruction. Mr Nygard denied the accusations.

114,Coronavirus: WHO report demands aged care overhaul after damning findings,The World Health Organisation has warned of problems in the aged care sector as the coronavirus pandemic rages around the world.  The World Health Organisation says the pandemic has revealed long-term issues in the aged care sector that have led to wealthy countries reporting up to 82 per cent of coronavirus-related deaths in nursing home facilities. ,"['world', 'coronavirus', 'health'] ['coronavirus']","Evidence gathered by WHO said once a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in an aged care home “it is difficult to control, in part due to the large number of people living close together in facilities designed for communal living and the fact that personal care requires close proximity”. The findings come as Victoria grapples with its own aged care crisis. Several elderly nursing home residents were left dead in their beds for hours in a Melbourne facility this week, according to The Australian. Senior doctors said multiple patients were left deceased for about six hours at the Epping Gardens Nursing Home in the city’s north. The Australian Defence Force was called in to assist with the situation after the ratio of staff to patients fell to 13 to one. The cluster at Epping Gardens Nursing Home has been linked to 90 cases so far and six deaths.

Of those who died, 10 were associated with aged care facilities. A WHO report said the pandemic had revealed issues being faced in aged care, saying it’s led to devastating impacts and an over-representation of infection and deaths. The report said in wealthy countries, COVID-19 deaths in aged care facilities account for “nearly half of all deaths”. Figures range from 24 per cent in Hungary to as high as 82 per cent in Canada. Research has shown the sector is affected by longstanding problems, including “underfunding, lack of accountability, fragmentation, poor co-ordination between health and long-term care, and an undervalued workforce”.

Early reports of the origin of the coronavirus, or “spillover event”, were that the virus jumped from animal to human within a wet market in the Chinese city of Wuhan sometime in late 2019. “The natural origin theory, although widely accepted, lacks substantial support,” Dr Yan writes in the report. “The alternative theory that the virus may have come from a research laboratory is, however, strictly censored on peer-reviewed scientific journals.

After becoming fearful of her safety, she fled China on a flight bound for Los Angeles in late April. Other scientists have disputed Dr Yan’s claim, including a report from Live Science in March, which definitively claimed “SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus”. Dr Yan’s newly published report echoes claims she made in a recent TV interview, when she appeared on the British talk show Loose Women.

But for some countries, it comes with a cost. Italy just recorded a total of 845 new cases – a high not seen since mid-May. Last Saturday, Italy registered 629 new cases in 24 hours, up from 500 on the two previous days. The Italian govenrment ordered the closure of nightclubs and made masks compulsory in certain outdoor areas at night. On August 1, the European Union opened its borders internationally, to select countries including Australia if they wished to come visit. They also opened their borders internally, meaning Italians are now able to have a summer holiday in other parts of Europe. The influx in cases has largely been triggered by people returning from holidays in other parts of Europe, such as Greece, Spain, Croatia and Malta. The government had since made it compulsory that travellers from these specific countries be tested for the virus upon returning. But it’s not just Italy. France just recorded another jump in cases, with 4711 new infections in the past 24 hours – a new record not seen since the height of the pandemic. France pictured at the height of the pandemic in March. (Photo by Ludovic Marin / AFP)Source:AFP Germany confirmed 1,707 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, the highest daily toll since April. Fernando Simon, the health ministry’s emergencies director, has warned that “things are not going well” there. “Nobody should be in any doubt, things are not going well … We cannot let the situation elude us again,” he told a press conference. The country recorded 3715 cases in the past 24 hours, with testing increasing. Meanwhile in Australia, NSW and Victoria appear to be getting recent “second wave” outbreaks under control. NSW has had several days of single-digit cases, recording just one case on Friday, but Victoria’s numbers are not falling as quickly as expected, leaving experts worred the current six-week lockdown will be extended. “On the five-day average graph, we reached a peak on July 30 and then plateaued one week to 10 days after mandatory masks were introduced,” Melbourne University epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely told news.com.au. “Cases fell quite quickly in the week following August 4, quicker than I expected but then in the last week — which is seven days after stage 4 lockdown — it’s actually slowed and that’s what I find odd. “It’s still going down, which is good, but at this rate of progress we’ll be lucky if we are at less than 50 cases a day by the end of the six-week lockdown.” The slower than expected decline could leave authorities with a tough decision to make at the end of the lockdown on September 13. Nurses help each other to put on a protective equipment at the intensive care unit of the Shefqet Ndroqi Sanatorium hospital. Picture: Gent SHKULLAKU / AFPSource:AFP There was hope Victoria would get its coronavirus case numbers down to low double digits or even single digits. Victorian president of the Australian Medical Association, Associate Professor Julian Rait told Today on Monday that low double digits would be “very manageable” for contact tracers and Victoria could “look forward very likely to the measures being relaxed at that point”. “I think many of my colleagues would like to see zero numbers but I think more realistically if it got down into the low double digits or even perhaps the single digits, that would be very manageable,” he said. “The idea would be that at that point you could have very aggressive contact tracing and be able to find all the possible contacts an test and isolating them as required. “So I think once the numbers get down to a very low level, it’s a much more manageable situation than it currently is.” However, if Melbourne ends its stage 4 lockdown with Victoria still recording 50 cases a day, this would remain a challenge for contact tracers. Victoria’s slow case improvement also opens up the possibility that the state’s lockdown may need to be extended, although this will ultimately come down to what its goal is. Prof Blakely believes elimination of community transmission is still possible in Victoria but concedes it’s now unlikely that authorities will go for this option due to the economic and social impacts of continuing a stage 4 lockdown. “If we are going for elimination, 50 cases a day is not nearly low enough,” he said. “It does look like Victoria is headed for suppression land. To achieve elimination from here would be a big effort, it would take political and social leadership and it’s possibly asking too much of the population.” - with Charis Chang ",news.com.au,,"August 22, 2020"

119,National abortion rights threatened by new US Supreme Court appointment,The rights of women to access abortions across the US are under threat as Republicans clear the way to target 40-year-old laws. Anti-abortion activists are “optimistic” the death of a liberal Supreme court justice will mean the reversal of more than 40 years of laws around abortion in the United States. ,"['world', 'north america', 'us politics'] ['Donald Trump']","Following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last week, Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of anti-abortion organisation the Susan B. Anthony List said she thinks the appointment of a pro-life Justice could be a turning point in reversing the Roe v Wade decision that legalised abortion in 1973. In the US, the landmark Roe v Wade decision ruled the US Constitution protects a woman’s right to have an abortion. But changes in the Supreme Court could lead to the decision being “overturned” or “eroded”, says Ms Dannenfelser. “No matter who you are, you feel the ground shaking underneath,” Ms Dannenfelser told The New York Times podcast The Daily on Wednesday. “I’m feeling very optimistic for the mission that our organisation launched 25 years ago.” And the US appears to be on course to rush through a new conservative Supreme Court justice, days after the death of Justice Ginsberg.

Picture: Mandel Ngan/AFPSource:AFP RELATED: Trump rallies anti-abortion activists Ms Dannenfelser, who formed an alliance with Donald Trump in 2016 before he was elected, said the first commitments they asked for from the President were “pro life Supreme Court justices”. “We wanted to be very clear that means they take a position on abortion that is in alignment with our own,” she said. “There was also a commitment to protect the Hyde Amendment, meaning no taxpayer (can) fund an abortion. “Also defunding and reallocating Planned Parenthood funding to other qualified health centres.” The organisation also asked the President for a bill against abortions after five months of pregnancy. Ms Dannenfelser said during the interview she believes with a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, Roe v Wade will be either “overturned” or “eroded so it’s not as applicable”. “The only laws that will pass will then be the laws that can be sustained by the majority of those states.” She said she believes then “people’s opinions” will be better able to make their way through into different state’s laws. Demonstrators support Planned Parenthood at a protest in St. Louis, Missouri in 2019. Picture: Saul Loeb/AFPSource:AFP After some dissent from senators within the Republican party over whether a new justice should be named before or after the upcoming Presidential election, it appears the path has now been cleared for Mr Trump to push through the appointment of a new conservative justice to replace Ms Ginsburg. The appointment would give conservatives a 6-3 majority on the court. The woman tipped to take the vacant seat is Amy Coney Barrett, 48, an appeals court judge, a devout Catholic, and a mother of seven children. Ms Barrett met with Mr Trump this week, and has already been criticised by Democratic politicians for her views on abortion and same sex-marriage. The judge defended herself, saying she’d “never impose my own personal convictions on the law”. Mr Trump is also due to meet with another potential candidate, Barbara Lagoa, 52, an appeals judge based in Miami. If the President successfully makes the appointment it will be his third supreme court appointment during his presidency and tip the court 6:3 towards the conservatives. During Barack Obama’s second term, Republicans refused to consider the then president’s own nomination nine months out from the election. – With wires ",news.com.au,,"September 24, 2020"

The video starts with an officer asking the boy, “Do you know where you are going? You are going to jail.” Another officer, who is not seen in the video, instructed the sobbing boy to stand up straight and put his hands behind his back. The officer then placed the boy against a filing cabinet and frisked him before taking out his metal handcuffs. As he cuffed the child, another officer not shown in the video, questioned whether the restraints would fit him. The boy was led out of his school and while waiting to be put into the back of a squad car, the police lectured the boy. “You understand this is very serious, OK?” the officer said, “And I hate that you put me in this position and that I have to do this. “The thing about it is you made a mistake and it’s time to learn and grow from it.

122,Coronavirus: What countries that crushed COVID-19 had in common,All the countries that crushed COVID-19 in its early days had one thing in common.  New research has found that countries led by women had “significantly better” COVID-19 outcomes when the virus was in its early days.,"['world', 'coronavirus', 'global'] ['coronavirus']","The research points to Germany’s Angela Merkel, New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern, Denmark’s Mette Frederiksen, Taiwan’s Tsai Ing-wen and Finland’s Sanna Marin – leaders whose countries all managed to avoid severe outbreaks of the virus experienced across much of the world. “Our results clearly indicate that women leaders reacted more quickly and decisively in the face of potential fatalities,” said Professor Supriya Garikipati, co-author of the study alongside Professor Uma Kambhampati. “In almost all cases, they locked down earlier than male leaders in similar circumstances. “While this may have longer-term economic implications, it has certainly helped these countries to save lives, as evidenced by the significantly lower number of deaths in these countries.” RELATED:   Follow our live coronavirus coverage here Taiwan, led by President Tsai Ing-wen, was hailed for its remarkable response to the pandemic. Picture: Taiwan Presidential Office/AFPSource:AFP The academics considered GDP, total population, population density and the number of elderly residents in their research. They also looked at annual health expenditure per capita, openness to global travel and the country’s level of gender equality. Given only 19 of the 194 countries referenced are led by women, the researchers created “nearest neighbour” countries with similar population sizes to make it fair. For example, Female-led New Zealand was paired with male-led Ireland, while female-led Germany was paired with male-led Britain and female-led Bangladesh paired with male-led Pakistan. “Nearest-neighbour analysis clearly confirms that when women-led countries are compared to countries similar to them along a range of characteristics, they have performed better, experiencing fewer cases as well as fewer deaths,” Ms Garikipati said. Ms Garikipati argued that “while women leaders were risk-averse with regard to lives, they were prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early”. She added: “It could well be that the relatively late lockdown decisions by male leaders may reflect male risk aversion to anticipated losses from locking down the economy.” The academics considered GDP, total population, population density and the number of elderly residents in their research. Picture: Sam Yeh/AFPSource:AFP The authors also noted “several incidents of risky behaviour” by men, including UK leader Boris Johnson’s claim he shook hands with “everybody” in a hospital with coronavirus patients prior to falling ill with the disease. However, the research is already a little outdated, with New Zealand’s new surge showing how quickly the virus can spread again. While it was initially hailed as a success story, New Zealand effectively ended its streak of zero COVID cases last week, after the first new cases were discovered. Over 60 cases have since been tied to that outbreak, with authorities now scrambling to keep the virus from spreading further. Authorities are still working to determine how the virus spread. Transmission through cold storage was a key theory last week, but Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said it was doubtful. “It seems clear now that the possibility is being ruled out from that investigation,” he said.

124,Coronavirus: How US destroyed itself during COVID-19 pandemic,Over four million cases. A skyrocketing death toll. Hospitals in crisis. Here are six reasons things went so horribly wrong in the United States.   Statistics alone can no longer capture the severity of America’s COVID-19 situation. ,"['world', 'north america'] ['coronavirus']","The country has recorded more cases and virus-related deaths than anywhere in the world, with over four million infections and over 146,000 fatalities. With Brazil trailing in second place at 2.4 million cases, followed by India at 1.38 million, the race isn’t even close. On July 17, the United States recorded its largest day-by-day case increase, with 77,217 new daily cases in just one day – eight thousand higher than the previous record. RELATED: Follow our live coronavirus coverage here  Ever since the first virus case hit American shores in February, there’s been no sign of it slowing down. A quarter of its four million cases came in the past 15 days. To give you an indication of how fast that is, consider that it took almost 100 days for the US to count its first million cases. How did it come to this? POPULATION SIZE A good indicator of how a country is coping with the pandemic is to compare its population size with its infection rate. A country with more people is likely to have more infections, so this “per capita” number of cases needs to be taken into account. President Donald Trump has frequently made the point that the US has the most cases because it has a large population and is testing the most people: Our Coronavirus testing is so much greater (25 million tests) and so much more advanced, that it makes us look like we have more cases, especially proportionally, than other countries. My message on that is very clear! There is a rise in Coronavirus cases because our testing is so massive and so good, far bigger and better than any other country. This is great news, but even better news is that death, and the death rate, is DOWN. Also, younger people, who get better much easier and faster! On the surface this sounds like obvious reasoning, but it’s disingenuous in that it fails to account for how dire the country’s situation is per capita. The US has a population of around 328 million people, representing around four per cent of the world’s population. But the country currently has over four million cases – over 25 per cent of the global total. To put that into perspective: Australia, with a population of 25 million, makes up around 0.33 per cent of the world’s population. Even with Victoria’s troubling case spike, Australia has just over 13,000 cases – or 0.08 per cent of the global total. Of course, there are other geographical factors at play. Australia is an island and relatively isolated from the other global hot spots. But that in itself isn’t enough to justify how uniquely problematic the situation is for America. PUBLIC MESSAGING Public health messaging in the United States has been convoluted since day one. Mr Trump has insisted on being at the forefront of the fight against the virus, holding numerous pandemic briefings. During these conferences, he gave advice that ran contradictory to medical experts including saying he would not be wearing a mask and pushed to reopen the US’s economy despite protests from health officials. Public health messaging in the United States has been convoluted since day one. (Photo by JIM WATSON / AFP)Source:AFP Throughout the first three months of 2020, Mr Trump insisted the virus was not a cause for concern. He compared it to the common flu, despite health experts repeatedly debunking this claim. He infamously sparked an outcry after suggesting that injecting disinfectant could be a potential solution – triggering a slew of calls to emergency rooms. It wasn’t until the end of March that the President first acknowledged the virus was “vicious”. He has since backtracked on this, falsely claiming this week that 99 per cent of cases are “totally harmless”. During the first week of April, the US recorded 10,000 COVID-19 deaths. The US Centres for Disease Control – the national body responsible for co-ordinating the virus response – has also come under criticism for its handling of the pandemic. The agency has been blamed for being too slow, too beauracratic, and developing a faulty test that meant private companies had to step in to fill the void. The World Health Organisation has also faced criticism – including from Mr Trump himself – for failing to name and shame states who were not taking strict enough measures, or impressing the seriousness of the threat on member states early enough. The US simultaneously had to contend with divergent views of state governors and a strong libertarian streak in some areas that saw protests over businesses being placed into lockdown. Dr Shaun Ratcliff, a lecturer in political science at the University of Sydney, said messaging about COVID-19 in Australia was comparatively coherent to the US, and stressed the seriousness of it. “Elements of the US government, both at a state and national level, have at times downplayed the severity of the virus, and there’s obviously been some mixed messages,” he told news.com.au. Mr Trump has more recently had a dramatic shift on the virus, stressing that the pandemic will likely get worse and urging people to wear masks. But even still, the messaging has been mixed. Two weeks ago, when Mr Trump did finally appear in public with a mask on for the first time, he stopped short of advising the public to wear them, merely saying that “it’s fine to wear one if it makes you feel comfortable”. ‘MORE TESTING’ The Trump administration often attributes the increase in virus cases to an increase in testing. On the surface, this may sound logical; the US is the third-most populated country in the world, and is conducting hundreds of thousands of tests per day. At a re-election rally in Oklahoma last month, Mr Trump described it as a “double-edged sword”, claiming he ordered that testing he slowed down. “When you do testing to that extent you’re going to find more people,” he told the crowd. “You’re going to find more cases, so I said to my people, ‘Slow the testing down please.’ “They test and they test and we got tests — people don’t know what’s going on. We got tests, ‘We got another one over here’.” He also blamed the “radical fake news” media for not giving him due credit, claiming he has “saved hundreds of thousands of lives”. The Trump administration often attributes the increase in virus cases with an increase in testing, but it’s not as simple as that. Picture: Joe Raedle/Getty Images/AFPSource:AFP But it’s not as simple as this. Even factoring in the number of tests the US is conducting, the situation isn’t good. A key problem with Mr Trump’s claim is that the rise in cases is far greater than the growth in testing. The average number of tests conducted in the US has grown by 80 per cent since early June, to 780,000 per day, according to a recent New York Times analysis. But 31 states show an increase in cases beyond what would be expected from expanded testing. Florida, one of the worst-hit states in the US, is reporting more than 11,000 cases per day. The analysis found that only 2400 cases per day would be expected when factoring in increased testing. The situation is similarly dire in California, Texas and Michigan. The Times calculated this by looking at the average positive test rate in each state for the two weeks ending June 9, and multiplied those rates by the number of tests done each day since. “These calculations assume that the severity of the outbreak in each state would remain about the same and that positive test rates would hold as testing expanded. This is the most that cases would increase as a result of increased testing,” the report explained. “As tests become more widely available and more people who are not sick take them, positive test rates should fall. “Instead, the United States is seeing the opposite: More tests are being conducted, but more are coming back positive, driving case counts even higher.” HEALTHCARE SYSTEM The United States does not have universal healthcare. Most Americans rely on their employers for health benefits, while nearly 27 million have no health insurance at all. In other words, tens of millions of Americans literally cannot afford to get sick. They will therefore delay getting tested for fear of the economic consequences. Given healthcare in the US is largely delivered by private companies, they are not required to maintain reserve capacity to handle a health crisis of this magnitude. The United States does not have universal healthcare – a key factor that’s impacted virus cases. Picture: David Dee Delgado/Getty Images/AFSource:AFP Dr Anthony Fauci, the scientific leader of America’s COVID-19 response, has repeatedly stressed that the system is broken. “The system is not really geared to what we need right now … let‘s admit it,” he said back in March. Earlier this month he warned the US could end up seeing 100,000 cases per day – and indeed, with a peak of over 77,000 last week, he’s not exaggerating. “I am not satisfied with what’s going on because we are going in the wrong direction if you look at the curves of the new cases,” Dr Fauci said.“So we’ve really got to do something about that and we need to do it quickly. Clearly we are not in total control right now.” Dr Ratcliff noted that paid sick leave – or lack of it – was also a factor. According to the Pew Research Centre, almost 25 per cent of Americans don’t have access to sick leave. While it’s become more common in recent years, lower-income workers are far less likely to have it, and only 28 per cent of civilian workers are given 10 or more days per year. “If you’re in a job where you don’t get sick pay, you might be reluctant to take time off, even if you’re not feeling well,” he said. SOCIAL ATTITUDES Research from the United States Studies Centre has found that Americans are relatively less likely to be compliant with lockdowns. According to public opinion research, two-thirds of Australians said that the measures are “about right” with no partisan variation. Just 36 per cent of Americans say the same, with 51 per cent of Trump supporters saying lockdowns and social distancing have gone too far. Six per cent of Biden supporters expressed this view too. “These deep partisan divisions are arguably both a symptom and cause of America’s struggle to contain the COVID-19 pandemic,” the USSC report said. Dr Ratcliff, who was part of this research team, said the coronavirus had become just another partisan issue in the United States. “The response in the US has become at least partially a partisan issue, where a lot of conservative media outlets in particular have played down the seriousness of the virus and the appropriateness of restrictions on mobility to combat it,” he told news.com.au. Research from the United States Studies Centre has found that Americans are generally less likely to be compliant with lockdowns. (Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP)Source:AFP “In Australia, we can find common ground on a lot of things, while in the US it’s actually really difficult to find a topic that Democrats and Republicans can agree on,” Dr Ratcliff said. “Unfortunately, COVID-19 has become just another topic where there is element of partisan disagreement, with Republicans in particular believing the lockdowns have gone too far.” REOPENING TOO QUICKLY Experts said a key problem was that the country’s more problematic states were trying to re-open themselves too quickly. Speaking on Podcast-19 earlier this month, America’s top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci said states like Florida and Arizona ignored the recommended guidelines on how to reopen, proceeding too quickly to get their economies moving again. “Certainly Florida I know jumped over a couple of checkpoints,” Dr Fauci said. “It’s pretty obvious that in some states, the governors or the mayors essentially jumped over the guidelines and the checkpoints, and opened up a little bit too soon. They were not prepared to deal with the resurgences that they saw.” Some experts have argued America reopened too quickly. (Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP)Source:AFP He said young people in particular “threw caution to the wind, and you see films of people very densely congregated at bars and in areas where they’re not looking at social distancing or wearing masks”. “I think what we’re seeing right now are the results of that, in four states that are accounting for 50 per cent of new infections.” The four states Dr Fauci was referring to were Florida, Arizona, California and Texas. The median age of those infected in Florida – the new epicentre for COVID-19 – has plummeted from 65 years old at the beginning of March to 39, suggesting younger, healthier people are transmitting the virus. WHAT’S NEXT FOR THE US? The situation in the US looks increasingly grim. Hospitals and labs are under severe strain – and that’s just from the people who go to hospital. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention estimated the true case total is probably 10 times greater than what’s officially been recorded. A total of 12 states have recorded infections of over 100,000. Based on its trajectory, the country will have easily surpassed five million cases within the next fortnight. And that might be one of the most alarming stats of all. @GavinDFernando  ",news.com.au,,"July 27, 2020"

127,Flight Centre taken to court over wage payments that allegedly short-changed workers,Flight Centre has been taken to court over wage payments that allegedly short-changed workers hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Flight Centre has been taken to court over allegedly underpaying workers hundreds of thousands of dollars. ,"['finance', 'business', 'travel'] []","The major travel group has been accused of the “systemic underpayment of workers through a dubious pay structure” that undercut wage awards prescribed under the Fair Work Act. The trial begins in Brisbane’s Federal Circuit Court on Monday. Maurice Blackburn Lawyers and the Together Union have brought the legal action against Flight Centre on behalf of five former workers who claim they were robbed of pay and entitlements totalling more than $200,000. The legal firm and the union said potentially thousands of current and former Flight Centre workers could be owed money under the pay structure, a target-based incentive scheme primarily made up of commissions. When the court action was filed in April last year, Flight Centre “categorically denied” the allegations.The company has since adopted a new enterprise agreement and changed the pay structure. Maurice Blackburn and the Together Union have brought the legal action against Flight Centre. Picture: Glenn Hunt/AAPSource:AAP Maurice Blackburn principal Giri Sivaraman said Flight Centre’s old pay structure was a complex system of commissions and top-ups that allegedly undercut the basic entitlements workers required under Australian law. “This system was without a doubt double-dipping by Flight Centre,” Mr Sivaraman said. “Flight Centre for years operated a dubious system that enabled them to use the same sum of money paid to workers for two different purposes. They ran a target-based incentive scheme for sales staff that paid commissions and then pointed to these same commissions to argue that they were meeting basic award requirements.” Mr Sivaraman also noted the Fair Work Act did not allow an employer to substitute commissions for a worker’s award entitlements. The legal firm and the union say potentially thousands of current and former Flight Centre workers could be owed money. Picture: Josh WoningSource:News Corp Australia “Workers should be rewarded for meeting targets without having to sacrifice their basic award entitlements, and companies like Flight Centre must ensure they are meeting the basic minimum under the award without relying on top-ups and commissions,” he said. Together Union secretary Alex Scott said major companies such as Flight Centre needed to be held to account in meeting payment obligations. “Flight Centre is a massive company who for years ran a calculated and deliberate system that relied on commissions to drive down the wages of its workers,” Mr Scott said. “That system allowed Flight Centre to repeatedly pay many workers under the award. “Flight Centre is not above the law, and that’s why we are fighting this landmark case on behalf of our members – this was systemic wage theft and they must be held to account.” Flight Centre has been contacted for comment.

128,Bill Clinton had secret dinner with Ghislaine Maxwell: report,A new report claims former US President Bill Clinton met with accused sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell for an “intimate” dinner in 2014. New reports have claimed former US President Bill Clinton met with accused sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell for an “intimate” dinner in 2014. ,"['entertainment', 'celebrity life'] ['Prince Andrew']","The alleged meeting is said to have happened well after Ms Maxwell’s boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein had pleaded guilty for soliciting minors for sex in 2008. Ms Maxwell, 58, is now in a Brooklyn jail after being charged earlier this year over the alleged abuse and grooming of minors as part of Epstein’s sex trafficking ring. Mr Clinton and Ms Maxwell met with a small group of friends at a vegan restaurant in Los Angeles after a celebrity Gala, according to a report from the Daily Beast. “This is an intimate dinner with Clinton in LA,” a source said. “Think of all the people (Clinton) knows in LA – and Ghislaine gets to attend.” A spokesman for Mr Clinton declined to comment to the Daily Beast other than to point to a statement issued by the former president’s team from 2019, that said, “President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York.” RELATED: Ghislaine Maxwell accused of shocking sex claim in unsealed documents  Ghislaine Maxwell reportedly had a dinner with Bill Clinton in 2014.

Picture: Stephen Jaffe/AFPSource:AFP RELATED: Ghislaine Maxwell begs for bail, says ‘I’m not Jeffrey Epstein’ Reports of Epstein’s abuse of minors and young women, and Ms Maxwell’s involvement, were being investigated by authorities for almost 10 years before the alleged dinner. Authorities began investigating Epstein in 2005 when a teenage girl, 14, made a report about being given money for a massage. Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for sex in 2008, and was sentenced to 13 months behind bars for the crime – but was given day release to go to work. In 2011, Virginia Giuffre accused Epstein, along with Ms Maxwell, of sexually exploiting her in an incident that involved Prince Andrew. Ms Giuffre alleged she was trafficked to the Prince for sex. Prince Andrew and Ms Maxwell have denied any wrongdoing. Ms Maxwell broke down in tears in July this year when a judge denied her bail to live in a “luxury” hotel in Manhattan, instead forcing her to remain behind bars for a year until her 2021 trial. Ms Maxwell had her hair in a bun and wore a brown T-shirt when she was told she’d be “ordered to be detained pending trial”. Ms Maxwell pleaded not guilty via video link to the charges related to grooming victims for Epstein’s sex trafficking ring. She was denied a $US5 million bond, and the judge blocked out three weeks for the trial in July 2021. ",news.com.au,,"September 24, 2020"
